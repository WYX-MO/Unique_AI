Foreword
To make progress, we must be able to measure progress. 
Data about the health of populations are foundational 
to understanding trends, making policies and directing 
resources to where they will have the greatest 
benefit. Without timely, trusted and actionable data, 
threats remain invisible, systems underperform and 
opportunities to save lives are lost.
World health statistics is the world’s annual health report 
card. It shows where progress has been made – and 
where it has stalled. This year’s edition highlights the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reversed many 
of the gains made in the previous two decades. Between 
2000 and 2019, healthy life expectancy rose by more 
than five years, maternal mortality fell by one third, child 
mortality more than halved and premature deaths fell – 
driven by political commitment, investment, innovation 
and stronger health systems. In 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 
killed millions of people, put health systems under severe 
strain and wiped 1.8 years off healthy life expectancy.
This report also shows that at the current pace, the world 
will miss the target in the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) to reduce premature deaths from 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by one third. While 
mortality rates have declined, the number of premature 
NCD deaths continues to rise, due to population growth 
and ageing. Tobacco use is declining but not fast 
enough, while alcohol consumption has decreased in 
some regions but stagnated in others. Hypertension 
and diabetes remain inadequately controlled, and air 
pollution continues to claim millions of lives globally.
Likewise, progress on maternal and child mortality has 
slowed considerably, and many countries are off- course 
for the 2030 targets, due to underfunding of primary 
health care and huge gaps in access to essential services, 
such as skilled care at birth, immunization and access 
to health workers. Domestic investment must increase, 
particularly because where the need is greatest, resources 
are most limited.
WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work translated 
the health-related targets in the SDGs into the “triple 
billion” targets for 2018–2025: one billion more people 
living healthier lives; one billion more people covered 
by universal health coverage without financial hardship; 
and one billion more people better protected from health 
emergencies. By the end of 2024, we estimate that the 
first target was already exceeded, but the second two are 
likely to be missed: about 1.4 billion more people were 
living healthier lives, but only 431 million more people 
were enjoying access to universal health coverage, and 
637 million more people were better protected from 
health emergencies – encouraging progress, but less than 
is needed to reach the SDGs. 
Nevertheless, it’s not 2030 yet. With stronger leadership 
and scaled-up delivery, the gap can still be closed. 
Accordingly, the Fourteenth General Programme of Work 
sets ambitious new targets: to keep 6 billion people 
healthier, expand access to affordable health services 
for 5 billion people, and to see 7 billion people better 
protected from health emergencies between 2025 
and 2028.
Health data are central to achieving these targets, which 
is why WHO is working with countries and partners 
to modernize information systems and link data to 
delivery, through the World Health Data Hub, the SCORE 
package of health data tools, and the Delivery for 
Impact approach.
Because every life counts.

Introduction
The World health statistics report is the annual 
compilation of health and health-related indicators, 
which has been published by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) since 2005. 
The 2025 edition consists of four chapters and the 
accompanying annexes. Chapter 1 presents an in￾depth analysis of global and regional estimates of life 
expectancy, healthy life expectancy and progress in the 
reduction of premature mortality. Chapter 2 reviews the 
status of the health-related Sustainable Development 
Goal (SDG) indicators, covering age- and cause-specific 
mortality, infectious diseases, risk factors for health, and 
universal health coverage (UHC) and health systems. 
A summary of global and regional trends towards the 
achievement of selected health-related SDG indicators is 
further presented in Annex 1. Chapter 3 presents updated 
projections on WHO’s Triple Billion targets, based on 
the most recent available data. It also describes WHO’s 
transition from its thirteenth general programme of 
work (GPW13) to the fourteenth general programme of 
work (GPW14), aligning with emerging global health 
challenges and priorities. Chapter 4 looks at inequalities 
in immunization as an important global health issue. 
The information presented in World health statistics 2025
is based on data available from global monitoring as of 
April 2025. These data have been compiled primarily from 
publications and databases produced and maintained 
by WHO, other United Nations entities (such as UNICEF, 
UNAIDS, and the Population Division in the Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations), United 
Nations Inter-Agency bodies of which WHO is a member, 
and other international organizations. A summary 
of the methodology for each chapter is described 
in Annex 2. Tables of health statistics by country 
and area, WHO region and globally can be accessed 
via https://www.who.int/data/gho/publications/

Key messages
The major contributors to the 5.4-year pre-pandemic 
increase in global healthy life expectancy (HALE) at 
birth between 2000 (58.1 years) and 2019 (63.5 years) 
were mortality reduction from communicable and 
perinatal conditions among ages under 5 years, and from 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among those 30 years 
and older. However, worsening morbidity due to diabetes 
among ages 30 years and older has led to a 0.14-year 
loss in HALE. Each WHO region exhibits distinctive 
patterns given their unique compositions of mortality 
and morbidity.
Between 2019 and 2021, the HALE loss can be almost 
entirely explained by mortality both directly and 
indirectly attributable to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
among those aged 30 years and older, both globally 
and in most WHO regions. The pandemic also caused 
increased morbidity from anxiety disorders and 
depressive disorders, each responsible for a 0.06-year (or 
3-week) loss in global HALE in 2019–2021, and together 
effectively wiped out 80% of the positive contribution to 
HALE (0.15 years, or 8 weeks) by mortality decline from all 
NCDs combined in that two-year period.
The contributors to the HALE difference between males 
and females show a mixed pattern. While lower female 
mortality from injuries among 5–69-year-olds and from 
NCDs including ischaemic heart disease and stroke 
among females of 30 years and older gives a lead in HALE 
compared with males, mortality in maternal conditions 
and breast cancers, and higher female morbidity from 
conditions including back and neck pain, gynaecological 
diseases, migraine, depressive disorders and anxiety 
disorders have effectively eliminated a considerable share 
of the female HALE lead.
While lower mortality from communicable and perinatal 
causes explains a significant amount of the HALE lead 
that populations in high-income countries (HICs) had 
against those in low-income countries (LICs) and lower￾middle-income countries (LMICs), higher mortality 
from tracheal, bronchus and lung cancers and drug use 
disorders, and higher morbidity from falls and back and 
neck pain has cost HICs some loss in HALE compared with 
other income groups.
Premature mortality was in decline globally and in all 
WHO regions from 2000 to the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Despite the overall progress prior to the 
pandemic, stagnation was seen after 2015. Globally, the 
pace of decline is projected to slow between now and 
2050, compared with the rates observed in 2000–2019. 
Only about one third of countries are projected to have 
accelerated progress in 2019–2050 compared with 
2000–2019, mostly located in the Region of the Americas 
and the Western Pacific Region.
As the world moves closer to 2030, overall progress is 
insufficient to meet the health-related SDG and other 
global targets. Declines were observed in mortality 
from causes addressed by the SDG indicators, including 
maternal mortality, child and neonatal mortality, 
premature NCD mortality, injury mortality, and mortality 
attributed to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene 
(WASH) and air pollution. However, the progress for 
all these indicators is either insufficient or stalled, and 
is currently off-track for achieving their respective 
global targets.
There has been mixed progress in the global fight against 
infectious diseases, with declines in HIV and tuberculosis 
(TB) incidence rates, as well as in the number of people 
requiring interventions against neglected tropical 
diseases (NTDs), while malaria incidence rates have 
increased since 2015 and hepatitis B and antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) continue to pose challenges.
Similarly, the world is off-track for meeting most of the 
global targets in reducing the prevalence or exposure 
to health risk factors such as malnutrition, tobacco use, 
unsafe WASH, air pollution and violence against women 
and girls, despite improvement in some of these areas.
However, the world is on-track to reach the 20% reduction 
in total per-capita alcohol consumption by 2030, although 
progress differs by region.
While gains in UHC service coverage index (SDG indicator 
3.8.1) were observed globally over the past two decades, 
progress has slowed in recent years. In 2019, some 
344 million people were pushed or further pushed into 
extreme poverty by out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending, 
while 13.5% of the global population spent more than 
10% of their household budget on OOP payments 
for health.
The estimated global shortage of health workers of 
15.4 million in 2020 decreased to 14.7 million in 2023. 
The projected 2030 shortage of 11.1 million shows slow 
progress in closing the gap, with the WHO African and 
Eastern Mediterranean regions projected to bear nearly 
70% of the shortage.
Progress towards achieving the Triple Billion targets 
remains uneven. The expansion of UHC is insufficient, 
with only about 431 million additional people gaining 
access to essential health services without incurring 
3
financial hardship by 2024 compared with the 2018 
baseline set in the WHO Thirteenth General Programme 
of Work, and only a projected 500 million by 2025 – just 
half of the targeted one billion. Meanwhile, close to 
637 million additional individuals are expected to be 
better protected from health emergencies by 2024. This 
is expected to increase to only 697 million in 2025 – a 
substantial gain that nonetheless remains a little over 
30% short of the one-billion target. On the plus side, 
an estimated 1.35 billion more people will experience 
healthier lives by 2024, rising to 1.5 billion by 2025, thus 
exceeding the original target of one billion. However, this 
progress remains insufficient to put the world on track 
to achieve the health-related SDGs by 2030. Moreover, 
recent interruptions in international aid threaten to 
disrupt health services and systems, disproportionately 
impacting countries and communities with the greatest 
health-care needs. Safeguarding the gains made 
towards the Triple Billion targets remains of paramount 
importance for the global community in the years ahead.
Within-country inequalities in childhood immunization 
related to economic status and education level of the 
mother persist. Positively, inequalities in the last decade 
have diminished, compared with those in the previous 
decade, in LICs and LMICs. For instance, economic-related 
inequality in DTP3 coverage and zero-dose prevalence 
have reduced by more than half across LICs. Eliminating 
economic-related inequality across 88 LICs and middle￾income countries is associated with improving the 
national average DTP3 coverage across these countries 
by 10 percentage points and halving zero-dose 
prevalence. Achieving equity in immunization coverage 
requires focused attention on urban poor areas, remote/
rural areas, conflict areas, and gender-related inequities 
and barriers.

Change and 
inequality in healthy 
longevity, and the 
contributing causes
Steady increases in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy 
(HALE) at birth were observed globally in 2000–2019, followed 
by rapid declines between 2019 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Various factors exhibit diverse epidemiological 
patterns across different stages in an individual’s life course 
and in different populations, contributing in various degrees 
to the change in life expectancy and HALE over time or 
the inequality therein between populations. This chapter 
reviews the contribution of different causes to the change in 
HALE before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to the 
inequality in HALE between males and females and between 
income groups as defined by the World Bank.
Unless otherwise stated, the principal source of data for 
this chapter is the World Health Organization (WHO) Global 
health estimates 2021 (1).
The global community enjoyed steady improvements 
in many aspects of population health between the 
turn of the century until the onset of the pandemic, 
from increasing access to clean water and sanitation 
to declining prevalence of tobacco smoking, from 
rising proportion of births attended by skilled health 
personnel (2) to doubling effective coverage for 
hypertension treatment (3), and from dropping mortality 
due to HIV/AIDS to improving child survival (4,5). These 
improvements led to a decline in mortality from a 
broad spectrum of causes of death throughout the 
human lifespan. 
Both life expectancy and HALE increased between 2000 
and 2019. Global life expectancy at birth increased 
by 6.3 years in this period, from 66.8 years in 2000 to 
73.1 years in 2019, with males gaining 6.2 years (from 
64.4 to 70.6 years) and females gaining 6.5 years (from 
69.2 to 75.7 years) during this period. Simultaneously, 
global HALE at birth increased by 5.4 years, from 
58.1 years in 2000 to 63.5 years in 2019 (from 57.0 to 
62.3 years for males and from 59.3 years to 64.6 years 
females) (Fig. 1.1).
However, this progress faced a major setback as the 
COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the globe. 
With COVID-19 becoming one of the leading causes of 
deaths globally and in many of the WHO regions in 2020 
and 2021 and claiming an excess toll of lives indirectly 
through other causes, both life expectancy and HALE 
rolled back by nearly a decade within just two years. 
Global life expectancy at birth dropped by 0.7 years to 
72.5 years in 2020 (back to the level of 2016), and by 
a further 1.1 years to 71.4 years in 2021 (back to the 
level of 2012). Similarly, global HALE at birth dropped 
to 62.8 years in 2020 (back to the level of 2016) and 
61.9 years in 2021 (back to the level of 2012) (Fig. 1.1).
This chapter reviews the contribution of different causes 
to the change in HALE before and during the COVID-19 
pandemic, and to the inequality in HALE between males 
and females and between income groups (6,7) as defined 
by the World Bank.

1.1 Change in HALE between 2000 
and 2019 
1.1.1 Global
Globally, the 5.4-year increase in HALE at birth between 
2000 (58.1 years) and 2019 (63.5 years) was a result of 
declining mortality and morbidity over time, contributing 
5.2 years (96.0%) and 0.2 years (4%), respectively. 
Reduction in mortality from communicable, maternal, 
perinatal and nutritional conditions (referred to as 
communicable diseases) represents the greatest source 
of gain, contributing a total of 3.4 years to the HALE gain, 
while mortality reduction from NCDs contributed 1.4 years, 
and injuries 0.4 years (Fig. 1.2). 
By individual cause and broad age groups, the largest 
gains were made by mortality reduction in preterm birth 
complications (0.26 years) and birth asphyxia and birth 
trauma (0.21 years) among infants aged 0–1 years, lower 
respiratory infections (0.40 years), diarrhoeal diseases 
(0.35 years) and measles (0.24 years) among children aged 
0–4 years, and tuberculosis (0.27 years) and HIV/AIDS 
(0.22 years) among adults aged 30–69 years. The gain 
attributed to NCD mortality reduction was concentrated in 
the adult age groups, with stroke contributing 0.37 years, 
ischaemic heart disease 0.28 years and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease 0.19 years among adults 30 years and 
older. While the majority of causes contributed to the HALE 
gain positively, increasing mortality linked to Alzheimer 
disease and other dementias among adults aged 70 years 
and older resulted in a slight two-week (0.04-year) HALE 
loss in 2000–2019 (Fig. 1.2).
While the overall contribution to the HALE gain from 
changing morbidity in 2000–2019 was relatively minor 
and, for the majority of causes, the contribution was 
positive, it is worth noting that morbidity from diabetes 
among adults 30 years and older increased and was 
responsible for a 0.14-year HALE loss in 2000–2019 
(Fig. 1.2).

1.1.2 WHO regions 
As the cause and the age profile of mortality and 
morbidity vary across geographical locations, the 
contributions to HALE by cause and age also exhibit 
diverse patterns. 
In the WHO African Region, the most remarkable 
contributor to the HALE gain in 2000–2019 was from 
reduction in HIV/AIDS mortality, resulting in a total 
of a 2.61-year gain in HALE, within which a reduction 
among adults aged 30–69 years was the major source 
(1.71 years). Decline in mortality from tuberculosis 
in the same age group also contributed to a large 
share (0.68 years or 57.6%) of the 1.18-year HALE gain 
accumulated throughout the entire life course. Mortality 
decline among children aged under 5 years from malaria, 
diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections also 
contributed considerably to the HALE gain in 2000–2019, 
at 0.88, 0.65 and 0.62 years, respectively (Fig. 1.3).

Similarly, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the 
South-East Asia Region, reduction in mortality from 
communicable diseases was the primary driver of the 
HALE gain in 2000–2019. Diarrhoeal diseases contributed 
a total of 1.01 years (0.47 years among those aged under 
5 years) in HALE gain in the South-East Asia Region and 
0.51 years (0.38 years among those aged under 5 years) in 
the Eastern Mediterranean Region. A mortality decline in 
lower respiratory infections among children aged under 
5 years led to HALE gains of 0.57 years in the South-East 
Asia Region and 0.38 years in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region. While the Eastern Mediterranean Region enjoyed 
a 0.26-year gain in HALE due to declining mortality from 
ischaemic heart disease among adults aged 30 years and 
older, the South-East Asia Region saw an opposite trend, 
with rising mortality from the diseases causing 0.16-year 
HALE loss among the same age groups. Also worth noting 
is the 0.3-year loss attributed to increasing diabetes 
morbidity among those aged 30 years and older in the 
Eastern Mediterranean Region, constituting the largest 
loss among all WHO regions. The Eastern Mediterranean 
Region is also the only region where a sizable HALE loss 
was attributed to mortality increase in collective violence 
and legal intervention, at 0.28 years, of which 0.24 years 
was due to rising mortality among those aged 5–29 years 
(Fig. 1.3). 
In contrast, in the Region of the Americas the contribution 
to the gain in HALE was more heavily concentrated 
in NCDs, with declining mortality among adults aged 
30 years and older from ischaemic heart disease 
(0.61 years), stroke (0.24 years), and trachea, bronchus 
and lung cancers (0.16 years) driving the gain (Fig. 1.3). 
However, some negative patterns were also observed. 
Rising mortality due to Alzheimer disease and other 
dementias among adults aged 70 years and older was 
responsible for a 0.12-year HALE loss. While improvement 
in mortality from diabetes contributed to a minor increase 
(0.03 years) in HALE in 2000–2019, worsening morbidity 
from the disease caused a 0.22-year loss. Additionally, 
drug use disorder in the Region of the Americas 
contributed negatively through increasing both mortality 
and morbidity, causing 0.11-year and 0.13-year losses, 
respectively, a unique phenomenon compared with all 
other WHO regions (Fig. 1.3).
In the European Region, there was a 4.69-year gain in 
HALE between 2000 and 2019, with 93.5% (or 4.39 years) 
of this gain attributed to declining mortality. By far, the 
leading driver in HALE gain was the decline in mortality 
from ischaemic heart disease among adults aged 30 years 
and older, accounting for a 1.07-year HALE gain, or over 
one fifth of the total gain. This is followed by mortality 
reduction from stroke among the same age groups, 
contributing to a further 0.66-year increase in HALE. 
The European Region also benefitted from reduced 
mortality from lower respiratory infections, road injuries 
and suicide across many age groups over the life course, 
achieving a HALE gain of about 0.2 years for each cause 
(0.6 years in total). However, increasing mortality from 
Alzheimer disease and other dementias among adults 
aged 70 years and older and increasing morbidity from 
diabetes led to a loss in HALE, at 0.08 and 0.14 years 
respectively (Fig. 1.3).
In the Western Pacific region, HALE increased by 
4.53 years between 2000 and 2019, about 97% (or 
4.43 years) of which was achieved by reducing mortality. 
The most prominent HALE gain was achieved through 
reducing mortality from stroke and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease among adults aged 30 years and 
older, accounting for an increase of 0.64 and 0.62 years, 
respectively. Declining mortality from birth asphyxia and 
birth trauma, preterm birth complications and lower 
respiratory infections among children aged under 1 year 
led to an increase in HALE of around 0.25 years for each of 
the three diseases (0.76 years in total). As in other regions, 
diabetes-related morbidity increased among adults aged 
30 years and older and caused a 0.1-year loss in HALE 
(Fig. 1.3).

1.2 Change in HALE during 
the COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2019–2021
1.2.1 Change attributed 
to mortality
The Global HALE dropped by 1.54 years between 2019 
and 2021. Mortality from the emerging COVID-19 and 
other outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic led 
to 1.29-year and 0.28-year losses, respectively, in HALE, 
totalling a staggering 1.57-year loss within just two years 
and exceeding the total gains in reduced mortality and 
morbidity from other causes. The majority of the loss was 
concentrated among those aged 30 years and older, at 
1.23 years and 0.27 years, respectively, attributed to the 
two causes (Fig. 1.4).
While gain due to continued decline in mortality 
from causes including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis was 
observed in 2019–2021 in the African Region, the region 
suffered from a net loss of 0.66 years in HALE. The loss 
is predominantly driven by mortality from COVID-19 
(0.74 years) and other COVID−19 pandemic-related 
outcomes (0.29 years) among adults aged 30 years and 
older (Fig. 1.4).

AFR AMR EMR EUR SEAR WPR Global
Much of the 2.72-year HALE loss in the Region of the 
Americas can be attributed to COVID-19 mortality among 
adults aged 30 years and older (1.92 years) and morbidity 
for all ages (0.15 years). Loss in HALE can also be 
explained by causes for which the previous pre-pandemic 
progress in mortality reduction was completely reversed 
or halted, including ischaemic heart disease, which 
contributed negatively to the HALE change between 
2019 and 2021 (–0.07 years in 2019–2021 vs 0.61 years in 
2000–2019) and stroke, which contributed almost no gain 
between 2019 and 2021 (compared with a 0.24-year gain 
in 2000–2019) (Fig. 1.4). 
Mortality from COVID-19 and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes among adults aged 30 years and older 
contributed 2.05 and 0.56 years, respectively, to the 
total 2.5-year HALE loss in the South-East Asia Region 
between 2019 and 2021. This outweighed HALE gains 
achieved through mortality reductions from causes 
including ischaemic heart disease (0.09 years) and stroke 
(0.08 years) among those aged 30 years and older during 
this two-year period (Fig. 1.4). 
The overall HALE dropped by 1.5 years in 2019–2021 in 
both the European Region (66.1 to 64.6 years) and the 
Eastern Mediterranean Region (60.4 to 58.9 years), and 
mortality from COVID-19 and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes among adults aged 30 years and older 
accounted for 1.35 and 0.25 years, respectively, of the 
loss in the European Region and 1.31 and 0.46 years, 
respectively, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region 
(Fig. 1.4). 
The COVID-19 pandemic had a very limited impact on 
HALE in the Western Pacific region in 2020 and 2021, 
resulting in virtually no change in HALE (68.4 years in 
2019 and 68.2 years in 2021). Mortality from COVID-19 
and other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes only 
accounted for 0.09 and 0.02 years of loss, respectively, in 
HALE, which were compensated for by minor gains from 
mortality decline from other causes, including stroke and 
road injuries (Fig. 1.4). 
1.2.2 Change attributed 
to morbidity
The decline in HALE between 2019 and 2021 at global 
and regional levels can be partly attributed to increasing 
morbidity. A shared pattern at both global and regional 
levels is that the HALE loss in 2019–2021 associated with 
morbidity increase can largely be attributed to three 
causes: COVID-19, anxiety disorders and depressive 
disorders. It is also worth noting that the pre-pandemic 
HALE gains in 2000–2019 attributable to declining 
morbidity from anxiety disorders and depressive 
disorders were completely cancelled out by the 
subsequent loss associated with these two causes during 
the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 1.4). 
Globally, morbidity due to COVID-19 led to a 0.13-year 
HALE loss in 2019–2021. The pandemic also caused 
increasing morbidity due to anxiety disorders and 
depressive disorders, each responsible for a 0.06-year (or 
3-week) loss in HALE in 2019–2021. This loss (0.12 years, 
or 6 weeks) effectively wiped out 80% of the positive 
contribution to HALE (0.15 years, or approximately 
8 weeks) by mortality decline from all NCDs combined 
in that two-year period. By WHO regions, morbidity due 
to COVID-19 led to HALE loss in 2019–2021 ranging from 
0.01 years in the Western Pacific region to 0.18–0.20 years 
in the South-East Asia Region, the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region and the African Region. Increasing morbidity due 
to anxiety disorders was responsible for losses ranging 
from 0.03 years in the African Region to 0.10 years in the 
Region of the Americas. Similarly, the contribution to 
overall HALE loss in 2019–2021 from increasing morbidity 
due to depressive disorders ranged from 0.01 years in the 
Western Pacific region to 0.11 years in the Region of the 
Americas (Fig. 1.4).
Change and inequality in healthy longevity, and the contributing causes

1.3 Gap in HALE between males 
and females in 2019 and 2021
1.3.1 Global
On average, women live longer than men, as they benefit 
from lower mortality, especially from causes that are 
affected by behavioural or genetic factors (8,9,10,11). 
In 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, the global 
female life expectancy was about 5.1 years longer than 
that of males (75.70 versus 70.61 years). However, with 
higher overall risk of morbidity among females, when 
disability is accounted for, the gap between the global 
male and female HALE in 2019 reduced to about 2.3 years 
(8,10). The lower level of mortality among females would 
have rendered them a 3.85-year advantage in HALE, yet 
they also faced higher levels of morbidity than males, 
offsetting the HALE advantage associated with mortality 
by 1.56 years (Fig. 1.5). 
Lower female mortality from NCDs among adults 
aged 30 years and older from ischaemic heart disease 
(accounting for 0.63 years), stroke (0.31 years), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (0.26 years), and 
trachea, bronchus and lung cancers (0.24 years) are 
major contributors to the female advantage in HALE. 
In addition, lower mortality among those aged 5–69 
years old from injuries including road injury (0.32 years), 
interpersonal violence (0.17 years) and suicide 
(0.12 years) constitute an important source of the female 
HALE advantage. However, mortality from sex-specific 
causes, such as breast cancer and maternal conditions, 
reduced the HALE advantage for females, at 0.22 and 
0.15 years, respectively (Fig. 1.5).

In addition, a higher rate of morbidity from many 
conditions has cost more healthy life-years among 
females. Back and neck pain, gynaecological diseases 
and migraine among females aged 30 years and older 
reduced female HALE by 0.39 years, 0.38 years and 
0.13 years, respectively, compared with males, and thus 
effectively eliminated the HALE advantage associated 
with mortality due to ischaemic heart disease and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, depressive 
disorders and anxiety disorders reduced the overall 
additional HALE for females by 0.20 and 0.16 years, 
respectively (Fig. 1.5).
In 2021, HALE for females was about 2.2 years higher than 
for males, representing the net of a 3.8-year advantage 
associated with mortality and a 1.7-year disadvantage 
associated with morbidity. In general, the mortality and 
morbidity contributors to the female–male gap in HALE 
remained largely the same, although the size of each 
contribution diminished to different degrees. What is 
most noteworthy is that lower female mortality from 
COVID-19 (0.72 years) and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes (0.17 years) have contributed to a 
0.89-year HALE advantage over males globally. This 
contribution is dominated by those aged 30 years and 
older (0.70 and 0.16 years, respectively, for COVID-19 
and other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes), a 
pattern that also holds true at regional and country levels 
(Fig. 1.6).

1.3.2 WHO regions
Similar patterns were observed across WHO regions, 
yet given each region’s unique epidemiological profile, 
there are distinctive characteristics in the health 
inequality between male and females in each region. 
In the African Region, sex-difference in mortality from 
communicable diseases was the primary source of the 
HALE gap (1.35 years) between sexes in 2019. Lower 
tuberculosis mortality among adults aged 30 years and 
older brought a 0.48-year HALE advantage to females. 
Lower mortality from lower respiratory infections among 
children aged under 5 years and adults aged 30 years and 
older contributed a further 0.30 years. However, these 
gains were partially offset by mortality from maternal 
conditions in reproductive ages, which cost females 
0.54 years in HALE (Fig. 1.5). In 2021, lower female 
mortality from COVID-19 and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes accounted for an additional 0.47 and 
0.18 years, respectively, in female HALE over male. This is 
predominantly contributed by females aged 30 years and 
older, accounting for 0.46 and 0.18 years, respectively, for 
the two causes (Fig. 1.6).
A unique contributor to the female HALE lead (2.49 years) 
in 2019 in the Region of the Americas was mortality due 
to interpersonal violence, accounting for 0.71 years of 
the HALE gap and predominantly concentrated in those 
aged 5–69 years (Fig. 1.5). In 2021, lower female mortality 
from COVID-19 and other COVID-19 pandemic-related 
outcomes explained 0.96 and 0.03 years, respectively, of 
the lead in female HALE (2.96 years in total) (Fig. 1.6). 
Stroke is the most significant cause of death that 
contributed to the female HALE lead (3.43 years in total) 
in the Western Pacific region in 2019, accounting for 
0.73 years (Fig. 1.5). In 2021, mortality from COVID-19 
and other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes had 
very limited impact on the HALE gap between males 
and females, accounting for only 0.03 and 0.01 years, 
respectively (Fig. 1.6).
The Eastern Mediterranean Region had the narrowest 
male–female gap in HALE in 2019, at 0.35 years. Mortality 
from collective violence and legal intervention stands 
out as a prominent driver for the HALE gap compared 
with other regions, contributing 0.45 years to the female 
HALE lead, with fatality among those aged 5–29 years 
accounting for over 90% of it (0.41 years). The relatively 
narrow overall HALE gap can be partially explained by 
large contributions from some conditions for which 
females faced higher mortality or morbidity, particularly 
morbidity from gynaecological diseases (–0.71 years) 
with women aged 20–69 years accounting for –0.66 years 
of this (Fig. 1.5). In 2021, the female lead in HALE 
declined slightly to 0.33 years, despite the addition of 
major contributions associated with mortality from 
COVID-19 (0.61 years) and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes (0.3 years). This was due to declining 
contributions from mortality from causes including 
collective violence and legal intervention (down from 
0.45 years in 2019 to 0.28 years in 2021) and ischaemic 
heart disease (down from 0.49 years in 2019 to 0.34 years 
in 2021) (Fig. 1.6).
The South-East Asia Region had the second lowest 
male–female gap in HALE in 2019 after the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region, at 0.90 years. Females benefitted 
from lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease, which 
accounted for 0.76 years of the female HALE advantage, 
primarily concentrated in those aged 30 years and older 
(0.75 years) (Fig. 1.5). The overall HALE gap remained 
relatively constant in 2021, at 0.91 years. Lower female 
mortality from COVID-19 and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes accounted for 1.28 and 0.33 years, 
respectively, of the lead in female HALE. It is worth 
noting that the contribution associated with ischaemic 
heart disease halved, to 0.37 years, compared with 2019, 
indicating that as a competing risk the emerging deaths 
attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic have narrowed the 
male–female mortality gap associated with ischaemic 
heart disease (Fig. 1.6).
Females in the European Region enjoyed a 2.98-year 
HALE lead in 2019 compared with males. Lower female 
mortality from ischaemic heart disease among adults 
aged 30 years and older represents the greatest 
contributor, accounting for a total of 0.91 years. Lower 
female mortality from trachea, bronchus and lung 
cancers in the same age group adds another 0.44 years 
to the female HALE lead (Fig. 1.5). In 2021, the male–
female HALE gap dropped to 2.76 years, with lower 
female mortality from COVID-19 and other COVID-19 
pandemic-related outcomes accounting for 0.65 and 
0.11 years, respectively, and the contribution associated 
with mortality from ischaemic heart disease (down to 
0.75 years) and trachea, bronchus and lung cancers 
declining from the 2019 levels (down to 0.36 years). 
Contributions from all four causes to the female HALE 
lead were concentrated in those aged 30 years and older 
(Fig. 1.6).

1.4 Gap in HALE between high￾income and other income 
groups in 2019 and 2021
Populations living in lower-resourced settings face many 
socioeconomic challenges and higher health risks than 
those living in higher-resourced settings (12), resulting 
in disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality 
from many causes and poorer overall health outcome as 
measured by life expectancy and HALE (1). 
When looking at HALE in high-income countries 
compared with other income groups (as classified by 
the World Bank), the main health issues that explain 
the differences – and how much they contribute – vary 
depending on which groups are being compared.
In 2019, people in high-income countries lived longer 
healthy lives partly because they had lower death rates 
from certain diseases and conditions, including birth 
asphyxia and birth trauma, preterm birth complications, 
lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases and
tuberculosis. These factors explained 4.08 years of the 
12.62-year HALE gap between high- and low-income 
countries, and 3.08 years of the 8.61-year gap between 
high- and lower-middle-income countries.
However, these same health issues only explained a small 
part – about 0.38 years – of the 2.08-year HALE difference 
between high- and upper-middle-income countries.
Other major health conditions that contributed to the 
HALE gap were ischaemic heart disease and stroke. 
Lower death rates from these conditions in high-income 
countries accounted for: 0.52, 0.95 and 0.4 years of the 
HALE gap due to ischaemic heart disease, and 1.14, 
0.76 and 1.01 years due to stroke, in comparisons with 
low-, lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries, 
respectively (Fig. 1.7).

Change and inequality in healthy longevity, and the contributing causes
15
Low-income Lower-middle-income Upper-middle-income
However, high-income countries did not succeed in every 
aspect. Higher mortality due to trachea, bronchus and 
lung cancers, particularly among adults aged 30 years 
and older, led to a negative contribution to the difference 
in HALE when comparing high-income countries against 
low-income (–0.17 years) and lower-middle-income 
countries (–0.2 years). Additionally, populations in high￾income countries on average faced higher mortality from 
drug use disorders in comparison with all the other three 
income groups, costing high-income countries 0.12, 0.13 
and 0.13 years of the HALE lead, respectively, compared 
with low-income, lower-middle-income and upper￾middle-income countries, respectively (Fig. 1.7).
High-income countries also sustained higher rates of 
morbidity due to some injuries and NCDs. While overall 
morbidity in high-income countries was still lower than 
that in low- and lower-middle-income countries in 2019, 
it was higher than upper-middle-income countries and 
led to a nearly 1-year negative contribution to the HALE 
gap between high- and upper-middle-income countries. 
The major causes leading to high-income countries’ 
disadvantage include falls (losing 0.32, 0.16 and 
0.21 years compared with low-, lower-middle- and upper￾middle-income countries, respectively), back and neck 
pain (–0.21, –0.38 and –0.36 years, respectively) and drug 
use disorders (–0.20, –0.20 and –0.19 years, respectively) 
(Fig. 1.7). 
These patterns in general continued in 2021. However, the 
different impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in individual 
income groups has influenced the gaps in HALE to various 
degrees compared with high-income countries. Lower 
mortality due to COVID-19 and other COVID-19 pandemic￾related outcomes in high-income countries accounted for 
the HALE lead of 0.25 years and 0.32 years, respectively, 
compared with low-income countries; 1.39 and 
0.47 years, respectively, compared with lower-middle￾income countries; and 0.21 and 0.14 years, respectively, 
compared with upper-middle-income countries (Fig. 1.8).

1.5 Progress in premature 
mortality reduction
Deaths occurring before the age of 70 years are 
considered premature and the majority of these deaths 
are preventable. Taking into account of the changing 
population structure over time and its difference across 
regions, the age-standardized death rate (ASR) for ages 
under 70 years was in steady decline from 2000 until the 
start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, both globally and 
at regional level. It is evident that before the COVID-19 
pandemic, NCDs were making up an increasing share 
of the ASRs of all deaths under age of 70 years across 
all WHO regions, while the share of communicable 
diseases was in decline (Fig. 1.9). In 2019, the African 
Region had the highest ASR of all deaths under age of 
70 years (665 per 100 000 population) among all WHO 
regions, over 80% higher than the global average (366 
per 100 000 population) and nearly triple that of the 
Western Pacific Region (233 per 100 000), the region with 
the lowest ASRs. The African Region also had the largest 
share of communicable diseases in the overall ASR under 
age of 70 years in 2019, at 47.4%, some 5.5 times of that in 
the European Region (8.6%), which had the lowest share 
(Fig. 1.9).

Percentage (%) Percentage (%)
The probability of dying before the age of 70 years is 
another important indicator for overall population health 
with a focus on mortality. Premature mortality had been 
in decline globally and in all WHO regions, from 2000 to 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, a newborn 
had about 40.4% chance of dying before reaching the 
age of 70 years in 2000, declining to 29.9% in 2019. Health 
disparities associated with geography and income are 
also significant. Africa, the WHO region with the highest 
premature mortality in 2019, had a probability (46.3%) 
of dying before the age of 70 years that was double 
that of the European Region (23.2%) and the Western 
Pacific region (21.5%), which had the lowest probability. 
Similarly, the probability in low-income countries 
(46.8%) was also more than double that of high-income 
countries (19.8%).
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a marked impact on 
global health, with global premature mortality increasing 
by 15.0% between 2019 (29.9%) and 2021 (34.3%). The 
pandemic impacts were unequal across WHO regions 
and World Bank income groups. The mortality toll due 
to COVID-19 was heaviest in relative terms in the Region 
of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region, where 
premature mortality increased by 28.9% and 23.7%, 
respectively. In contrast, the pandemic had a limited 
impact in the African Region and the Western Pacific 
Region, where premature mortality increased by just 5.7% 
and 2.0%, respectively, between 2019 and 2021. By World 
Bank income groups, the premature mortality in low￾income countries increased modestly, by just 5%, during 
the first two years of the pandemic, while all other income 
groups experienced a 14.3–17.8% increase. 
Despite the overall progress pre-pandemic, stagnation 
was seen after 2015. The global annual rate of reduction 
(ARR) in premature mortality was just 1.1% between 2015 
and 2019, down from 1.7% during 2000–2015. Among 
WHO regions, the Region of the Americas and the South￾East Asia Region experienced the greatest slowdown, 
with ARR halving between 2015 and 2019 compared with 
2000–2015. The Eastern Mediterranean Region was the 
only region where some acceleration was seen in 2015–
2019, while the progress in the African Region slowed 
only slightly and the region continued to have the most 
rapid rate of decline in premature mortality, followed by 
the European Region. Similarly, progress slowed in 2015–
2019 across all World Bank income groups, with low￾income countries seeing the smallest relative reduction 
in ARR and remaining the group with the fastest declining 
premature mortality.
1.5.1 The prospect of 
premature mortality 
by 2050
Using the WHO mortality estimates in 2019 as the 
baseline and incorporating the projected age–sex￾specific mortality trends by country from the United 
Nations World population prospects 2024 (13), it is 
anticipated that the reduction in premature mortality 
during the three decades between 2019 and 2050 would 
be moderate compared with the observed progress in 
2000–2019. Globally, the probability of dying before 
the age of 70 years is projected to decline by 24.2% 
between 2019 and 2050, with reductions ranging from 
20.2% in the African Region and 24.5% in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region to 33.9% in the Western Pacific 
region and 35.4% in the South-East Asia Region. This 
represents a global slowdown, given it had taken one 
fewer decade to achieve a slightly larger reduction 
(26.1%) in 2000–2019, equivalent to an estimated ARR of 
1.6%, compared with only a projected 0.9% in 2019–2050. 
Overall, only about one third of countries are projected to 
have accelerated progress in 2019–2050 compared with 
2000–2019. This would largely occur in the Region of the 
Americas and the Western Pacific Region, where at least 
half of the countries (76% and 52%, respectively) would 
see an acceleration (Fig. 1.10). Upper-middle-income 
countries are the only World Bank income group where 
more than half (52%) of the countries are projected to 
see accelerated progress in 2019–2050, while only four 
(or 15%) of the low-income countries will achieve this 
(Fig. 1.10).
The Region of the Americas is the only WHO region that 
is expected to see some accelerated progress, with a 
projected ARR at 1.2% in 2019–2050, up from 0.9% in 
2000–2019. While the ARR in the South-East Asia Region 
is expected to be largely stable, the other four regions 
are all expected to see considerable deceleration, with 
ARR dropping by up to 60% in the African Region. Slowed 
progress is projected for all World Bank income groups. 
Although a one-third reduction in premature mortality 
is expected in both upper-middle-income and high￾income countries in 2019–2050, the ARRs are considerably 
lower than that in 2000–2019 (down by 31.4% and 
19.5%, respectively). The ARR in low-income countries is 
expected to be more than halved the level in 2000–2019, 
leading to only about a one-fifth reduction in premature 
mortality in 2019–2050.

Should the global community wish to halve premature 
mortality by 2050 (14), considerable acceleration 
would be needed in reducing mortality rates in those 
aged 0–69 years in the next three decades. The global 
decline would have to be 1.4 times the observed rate 
in 2000–2019 to cut the premature mortality in 2019 
by half by mid-century. The required regional rate of 
acceleration relative to the ARR in 2000–2019 would range 
from 1.1 times in the European Region and the Western 
Pacific region to 2.4 times in the Region of the Americas, 
and from 1.2 times in upper-middle-income countries 
to 1.6 times in lower-middle-income countries. Allowing 
the mortality trends to continue as projected without 
interventions would shift a heavier burden of acceleration 
for meeting the target to future years. At the projected 
ARR for 2019–2050, a minimum of 2.5 times acceleration 
is required to halve premature mortality by 2050 globally, 
and a minimum of about a threefold acceleration in the 
African Region and low-income countries.

Health-related 
Sustainable 
Development Goals
This chapter presents the latest available evidence of trends in 
health-related SDG indicators, assessing progress towards achieving 
the global targets. The topics covered in this chapter include child 
mortality, cause-specific mortality, infectious diseases, risk factors for 
health, and UHC and health systems. 
2.1 Mortality-related Sustainable 
Development Goal indicators
2.1.1 Maternal and child 
mortality 
Maternal mortality 
Globally, an estimated 260 000 (uncertainty interval [UI]: 
230 000–309 000) women died in 2023 due to maternal 
conditions, equivalent to an overall maternal mortality 
ratio (MMR; SDG indicator 3.1.1) of 197 (UI: 174–234) 
maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. This represents 
a decline in the global MMR by 40% since 2000, when 
the rate was 328 (UI: 308–352) per 100 000 live births. 
Between 2000 and 2023, the average ARR in global MMR 
was 2.2% (UI: 1.4–2.8%). This led to a significant fall in 
the number of maternal deaths globally, from 444 000 in 
2000 to 260 000 in 2023. A closer examination of the first 
eight years of the SDG era, between the beginning of 2016 
and the end of 2023, reveals that the global MMR declined 
by 10%, from an estimated 220 (UI: 203–242) maternal 
deaths per 100 000 live births, at a global average ARR of 
1.6% (UI: 0.04–2.7%) (1). If this ARR were to continue until 
2030, the global MMR would be 177 in 2030 – two and a 
half times the SDG target (below 70) (1,2). Achieving the 
SDG target will require an average ARR of 14.8% over the 
remaining seven years (2024–2030). This represents an 
unprecedented challenge and would be equivalent to 
almost 700 000 deaths averted between 2024 and 2030, 
compared with a scenario where the 2016–2023 global 
ARR continues.
MMR declined in all WHO regions between 2000 and 2023. 
The greatest decline was achieved in the South-East 
Asia Region, where MMR declined by 73.6%, from 365 
(UI: 336–407) in 2000 to 96 (UI: 86–112) maternal deaths 
per 100 000 live births in 2023 (Fig. 2.1). This equates to an 
average ARR of 5.8% (UI: 5.1–6.5%). MMR also declined by 
56.0% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 55.2% in the 
European Region, 51.2% in the Western Pacific Region, 
and 39.6% in the African Region between 2000 and 2023. 
The smallest percentage reduction in MMR was in the 
Region of the Americas at 16.9%, equivalent to an ARR of 
0.8% (UI: 0.2–1.3%).

MMR (deaths per 100 000 live births)
In 2023, the African Region had a high MMR of 442 
(UI: 376–560) per 100 000 live births and alone accounted 
for approximately 70% of global maternal deaths in 2023. 
The Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions 
each accounted for about 12% of global maternal deaths, 
with MMRs of 167 (UI: 135–218) and 96 (UI: 86–112), 
respectively. The MMR was also low in the Region of 
the Americas, at 59 (UI: 52–66), and the Western Pacific 
Region, at 35 (UI: 30–42). The European Region had a very 
low MMR in 2023, at 11 (UI: 10–13) (Fig. 2.1) (1).
Under-five mortality
Child survival has improved remarkably since 2000, 
with the global under-five mortality rate (U5MR; SDG 
indicator 3.2.1) declining by more than half (52%) in the 
last two decades, from 77 (UI: 76–78) deaths per 1000 
live births in 2000 to 37 (UI: 35–41) deaths per 1000 live 
births in 2023 (Fig. 2.2). Accordingly, the number of global 
under-five deaths fell to 4.8 million (UI: 4.5–5.3 million) 
in 2023, a number that is still unacceptably high, despite 
accounting for less than half of the under-five deaths 
in 2000 (10.1 million [UI: 9.9–10.2 million]) and almost 
two thirds less than the estimated 13 million (UI: 12.8–
13.2 million) in 1990 (3). 
Although the progress is noteworthy at global level, stark 
inequalities persist across regions and income levels. 
The WHO African Region remains the region with the 
highest U5MR, estimated at 67 (UI: 60–80) deaths per 
1000 live births in 2023 (Fig. 2.2). The African Region alone 
accounted for 55% (2.6 million [UI: 2.4–3.1 million]) of the 
global deaths of children under age 5 in 2023. In 2023, 
the U5MR in low-income countries (LICs) (62 [UI: 56–75] 
deaths per 1000 live births) and lower-middle-income 
countries (LMICs) (43 [UI: 39–50] deaths per 1000 live 
births) was, respectively, 13 and 9 times the rate in high￾income countries (HICs) (5 [UI: 5–5] deaths per 1000 live 
births) (3).
Globally, infectious diseases, including acute respiratory 
infections, malaria and diarrhoea, along with pre-term 
birth complications, birth asphyxia and trauma, and 
congenital anomalies remain the leading causes of death 
for children aged under 5. Access to basic lifesaving 
interventions such as skilled delivery at birth, quality 
postnatal care, early and continued breastfeeding and 
adequate nutrition, immunization and treatment for 
common childhood diseases can save many young 
lives (3).

Under-five and neonatal mortality rate (per 1000 live births)
Neonatal mortality Under-5 mortality
Neonatal mortality
The number of deaths occurring in the first 
28 days of life (the newborn period) declined from 
4.2 million (UI: 4.0–4.3 million) in 2000 to 2.3 million 
(UI: 2.1–2.6 million) in 2023. However, the 45% decline in 
the neonatal mortality rate (NMR; SDG indicator 3.2.2) from 
2000 (31 [UI: 30–32] deaths per 1000 live births) to 2023 (17 
[UI: 16–19] deaths per 1000 live births), has been slower 
compared with the 58% decline in the mortality rate of 
children aged 1–59 months (from 47 [UI: 47–48] deaths per 
1000 children aged 28 days in 2000 to 20 [UI: 18–23] deaths 
per 1000 children aged 28 days in 2023) (Fig. 2.2). This has 
led to a larger share of global newborn deaths among total 
under-five deaths, up from 41% in 2000 to 48% in 2023 (3).
The chances of survival through the first 28 days of life vary 
depending on where a child is born. The African Region had 
the highest regional NMR in 2023, at 26 (UI: 23–31) deaths 
per 1000 live births, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region with 24 (UI: 21–29) deaths per 1000 live births. The 
South-East Asia Region had the highest regional NMR in 
1990 at 53 (UI: 51–55) deaths per 1000 live births (Fig. 2.2), 
but has experienced a sharp decline with a ARR of 3.6% 
(UI: 3.2–4.0%) double that of the African Region (1.7% 
[UI: 1.1–2.0%]) in 1990–2023. Country-level NMR in 2023 
ranged from 0.6 to 40.2 deaths per 1000 live births and the 
risk of dying before the 28th day of life for a child born in 
the highest-mortality country was approximately 65 times 
higher than the lowest-mortality country (3).
Meeting the SDG targets for child survival 
If current trends continue, 60 countries will not meet the 
SDG target for under-five mortality. Of these, 47 countries 
will need to more than double their current rate of progress 
or reverse an increasing trend and then accelerate progress 
to achieve the SDG target by 2030. Even more countries are 
at risk of missing the SDG target for neonatal mortality. A 
total of 65 countries will need to accelerate the mortality 
decline to meet the target on time, with 59 of those 
countries needing to more than double their current rate of 
decline or reverse an increasing trend to meet the target by 
2030. Reaching this target in all countries will avert 8 million 
under-5 deaths between 2024 and 2030, some 42% of which 
would be among neonates (3). 
2.1.2 Mortality due to 
noncommunicable 
diseases 
Globally, in 2021, some 18 million people under the age 
of 70 years died from an NCD, accounting for over half of 
deaths in that age group. The risk of premature death 
from NCD, which is measured by SDG indicator 3.4.1, 
is the unconditional probability of dying from any of the 
four main NCDs (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes 
or chronic respiratory disease) between the ages of 30 and 
70 years (2). It is estimated that, in 2000, a 30-year-old had 
a 22.5% chance of dying from one of the four main NCDs 
before the age of 70 years. This risk fell to 18.4% in 2015 
and further to 18.0% in 2019, just prior to the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic (4). The reliability of the estimated risk 
during 2020–2021 was potentially affected by disruptions 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as countries’ ability 
to monitor trends in NCD mortality was compromised 
and may have resulted in misclassification of NCD deaths. 
Where reliable data are available, the risk of premature 
death from an NCD plateaued during this period. 
The observed pre-pandemic trend translates to an ARR of 
1.3% between 2000 and 2015 and 0.5% between 2015 and 
2019, indicating a remarkable deceleration in progress. 
With the required ARR to meet the one-third reduction 
in premature NCD mortality standing at 2.7%, the pre￾pandemic progress since 2015 was equivalent to just one 
fifth of what is needed to meet the target and calls for 
coordinated action to prevent and treat NCDs.
The level and pace of progress vary by WHO region. 
The Eastern Mediterranean Region faced the highest 
risk of premature NCD mortality in 2000 (26.9%), which 
progressively declined to 22.7% in 2019, at a level that 
was only lower than the South-East Asia Region (22.9%) 
that year. Despite the higher risk compared to most other 
regions, the Eastern Mediterranean Region is the only 
region where some acceleration of progress was observed 
during the SDG era (ARR at 1.2% in 2015–2019 compared 
with 0.8% in 2000–2015). In contrast, the South-East Asia 
Region saw overall stagnation in 2000–2019, with a slight 
uptick in risk between 2015 and 2019. The African Region 
(23.6% in 2000) experienced a moderate but steady decline, 
with an ARR at about 0.6% in 2000–2019 and reaching a 
premature NCD mortality of 21.0% in 2019. The European 
(23.9% in 2000) and Western Pacific (21.9% in 2000) Regions 
saw the fastest decline among all regions during both 
2000–2015 (ARRs at 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively) and 
2015–2019 (ARRs at 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively), reaching 
premature NCD mortality of 16.3% and 15.7%, respectively, 
in 2019. The Region of the Americas had the lowest risk of 
NCD premature mortality in 2000 (18.0%) and remained 
the lowest in 2019 (13.9%), although the pace of progress 
slowed, with an ARR at 1.4% in 2000–2015 and 1.1% 
in 2015–2019.
Based on these results, it is evident that neither the 
world nor any one region is on track to meet the target of 
reducing the risk for premature NCD mortality by one third 
by 2030. The South-East Asia Region, where premature NCD 
mortality has remained high since 2000, is at greatest risk of 
missing the target (Fig. 2.3).

2.1.3 Mortality due to injuries
Road injury 
In 2021, an estimated 1.18 million (UI: 1.05–1.32 million) 
people died due to road injuries globally (SDG indicator 
3.6.1). The greatest burden was observed in South-East 
Asia Region, with around 318 000 (UI: 283 000–358 000) 
deaths, or 28% of the global burden, and the Western 
Pacific Region with almost 296 000 (UI: 276 000–316 000) 
deaths, or 25% of the global burden. Together, these 
regions account for more than half of the global road 
traffic deaths. These are followed by the African Region 
(229 000 [UI: 185 000–274 000] deaths); the Region of 
the Americas (146 000 (UI: 135 000–158 000) deaths); the 
Eastern Mediterranean Region (128 000 [UI: 108 000–
145 000] deaths); and the European Region (64 000 
[UI: 58 000–68 000] deaths) (4,5). 
The African Region had the highest crude death 
rate (CDR) in 2021 (19.5 [UI: 15.7–23.4] per 100 000 
population). This was nearly three times that of the 
European Region, which had the lowest rate of 6.8 
(UI: 6.2–7.3) per 100 000 population (Fig. 2.4). By World 
Bank income levels, the highest death rate from road 
injuries was observed in LICs, at 21.1 (UI: 16.8–25.2) per 
100 000 population, while the lowest was in HICs, at 8.1 
(UI: 7.5–8.6) per 100 000 population. Disparity between 
sexes was also evident. Males were at elevated risk of 
dying from road injuries compared with females. Globally, 
the male-to-female ratio of CDRs from road injuries was 
3.0, ranging from 2.3 in the African Region to above 3.5 
in the South-East Asia Region and the Region of the 
Americas (4). 
Health-related Sustainable Development Goals
25
Risk of premature death from major NCDs (%)
Road fatalities declined by 5.5% from 2010–2021, falling 
from 1.25 million (UI: 1.11–1.39 million) deaths in 2010 (4). 
This is equivalent to a decline from 17.9 (UI: 15.7–19.9) 
deaths per 100 000 population to 14.9 (UI: 13.2–16.6) 
deaths per 100 000 population, and is in spite of the 
growth in global population and number of vehicles. This 
indicates that while efforts to enhance road safety are 
making progress, they remain insufficient to achieve the 
United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021–
2030 goal of reducing deaths and injuries by half by 2030 
(6). There was also a universal decline in the CDRs across 
all regions in the period. The slowest progress was seen in 
the Region of the Americas, although rates still declined 
by 8.9%, from 15.6 (UI: 14.5–16.7) per 100 000 population 
in 2010 to 14.2 (UI: 13.1–15.4) per 100 000 population 
in 2021.
Suicide 
An estimated 727 000 people died from suicide globally 
in 2021, corresponding to a crude suicide mortality rates 
(CDR; SDG indicator 3.4.2) of 9.2 (UI: 6.9–11.6) per 100 000 
population. The rate in males (12.4 (UI: 9.6–15.4) per 
100 000) was more than double that in females (5.9 (UI: 
4.2–7.7) per 100 000). The highest male-to-female ratio 
was found in the European Region (3.4) and the Region of 
the Americas (3.7), while the lowest was in the South-East 
Asia Region (1.4) (4).
Crude suicide mortality rates and their change over 
time exhibited wide variations across WHO regions. The 
European Region had the highest rate among all regions 
in 2000 (21.5 [UI: 19.9–23.0] per 100 000 population), but 
has seen rapid decline, with the rate falling by over two 
fifths, to 12.4 (UI: 10.3–14.4) per 100 000 population in 
2021. A rapid decline was also seen in the Western Pacific 
Region, where the rate in 2000 (14.7 [UI: 10.1–16.9] per 
100 000 population) fell by 35% to 9.5 (UI: 7.1–12.3) per 
100 000 population in 2021. However, a slight increase 
was seen in the African Region, where the CDR from 
suicide in 2021 (7.3 [UI: 4.5–10.7] per 100 000 population) 
was about 5% higher than in 2000 (6.9 [UI: 4.5–10.0] 
per 100 000). The Region of the Americas has seen a 
concerning trend, with the rate increasing by nearly 30% 
from 7.6 (UI: 7.1–8.3) per 100 000 population in 2000 to 
9.9 (UI: 8.9–11.0) per 100 000 population in 2021. The 
South-East Asia Region had the second highest rate 
after the European Region in 2021 (10.1 [UI: 7.4–12.6] 
per 100 000), yet experienced a 20.4% decline from the 
rate in 2000 (12.7 [UI: 9.4–15.1] per 100 000). The Eastern 
Mediterranean Region continued to have the lowest rate 
throughout the period, with a 24.3% decline from 4.7 (UI: 
2.7–7.4) per 100 000 population in 2000 to 3.6 (UI: 2.0–5.9) 
per 100 000 population in 2021 (Fig. 2.4) (4).
Homicide 
Nearly 484 000 (UI: 360 000–648 000) people were 
victims of intentional homicide (defined as the unlawful 
death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause 
death or serious injury) in 2021. Despite having a slight 
increase from 480 000 (UI: 400 000–578 000) in 2000, this 
corresponded to a decline in CDR of 27.1%, from 7.8 (UI: 
6.5–9.4) per 100 000 population (SDG indicator 16.1.1) in 
2000 to 6.1 (UI: 4.5–8.2) per 100 000 population in 2021 
(Fig. 2.4). About 80% of the victims were men (4).
The WHO Region of the Americas had the highest 
mortality burden from homicide in 2021, with a total of 
198 000 (UI: 169 000–232 000) deaths, equivalent to a 
CDR of 19.3 (UI: 16.4–22.6) per 100 000 population – triple 
the global average. This region accounted for 40.9% of 
the total global homicide deaths but only 12.9% of the 
global population. In contrast, the Western Pacific Region 
accounted for about a quarter of the global population, 
but only 6.1% of global homicide deaths, with a CDR (1.5 
(UI: 1.1–2.1) per 100 000 population) that was 8% of that 
in the Region of the Americas. The African Region had 
the second highest CDR in homicide mortality in 2021, 
with a CDR that was only half of that in the Region of the 
Americas, at 9.7 (UI: 5.9–15.0) per 100 000 population, 
accounting for 114 000 deaths. Compared with the 
Region of the Americas and the African Region, the CDR 
of homicide was also relatively low in the European, 
South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, at 
2.6 (UI: 2.1–3.3) per 100 000 population, 3.7 (UI: 2.7–4.9) 
per 100 000 population and 5.4 (UI: 3.2–8.5) per 100 000 
population, respectively (Fig. 2.4) (4).
Men face disproportionately higher risk of homicide 
deaths than women and the sex disparity was unevenly 
distributed across WHO regions. Globally, the male-to￾female ratio for CDR for homicide mortality in 2021 was 
4.0, ranging from 2.9 in the European Region to 7.7 in the 
Region of the Americas. A strong age pattern was also 
observed, with young adults aged 20–29 years having the 
highest age-specific mortality rate, peaking at over 12 
deaths per 100 000 population globally and up to nearly 
40 deaths per 100 000 population in the Region of the 
Americas (4).
Unintentional poisoning 
Globally, about 59 000 (UI: 32 000–91 000) people 
died from unintentional poisoning in 2021, a decline 
of approximately 4600 from 2000 (64 000 [UI: 47 000–
92 000]). This represents a decline of a quarter from a 
CDR of 1.0 (UI: 0.8–1.5) to 0.7 (UI: 0.4–1.1) per 100 000 
population (SDG indicator 3.9.3). The highest CDRs in 
2021 were observed in the WHO African Region, at 1.2 
(UI: 0.7–2.1) per 100 000 population, closely followed by 
the Western Pacific Region at just under 1.2 (UI: 0.5–1.7) 
World health statistics 2025: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals
26
per 100 000 population. The greatest decline in CDR 
was achieved in the European Region, with a decline of 
nearly two thirds between 2000 and 2021, followed by 
the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, 
with a 36% and 30% decline, respectively. However, the 
rate stagnated in the African Region and a slight increase 
was seen in the Region of the Americas and the Western 
Pacific Region (Fig. 2.4) (4).
Sex and age disparities were observed. Men are at higher 
risk of dying from unintentional poisoning. Men died at a 
rate 67% higher than women in 2021, primarily 
due to occupational hazards and higher rates of risky 
behaviours. The Region of the Americas and the European 
Region saw the highest male-to-female ratios, at 2.2 
and 2.6 respectively, whereas the lowest ratio was in 
the African Region, at 1.4. Additionally, the youngest 
and oldest populations were at the highest risk of dying 
from unintentional poisoning, with those aged under 5 
years and 65 years and older accounting for just 18% of 
the global population but 38% of the global deaths from 
unintentional poisoning in 2021 (4).

2.1.4 Mortality attributable 
to environmental 
risk factors
Air pollution mortality
Almost the entire global population is exposed to outdoor 
(ambient) air pollution in both cities and rural areas and 
more than a quarter (2.4 billion) is exposed to dangerous 
levels of household air pollution. Exposure to air pollution 
increases the risk for many negative health outcomes (7). 
Five health outcomes – acute lower respiratory infections, 
lung cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, ischemic heart 
disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – are 
currently included in SDG indicator 3.9.1 on mortality 
attributed to air pollution from particulate matter. In 
2019, an estimated 6.7 million deaths worldwide were 
attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution from 
particulate matter jointly – corresponding to an age￾standardized mortality rate of 104 (UI: 81–130) deaths 
per 100 000 population (8,9). People living in LICs and 
middle-income countries (MICs) disproportionately bear 
the burden of outdoor air pollution (see also section 2.3.3 
subsection “Air pollution”).

Millions of people globally lack access to safe water, 
sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and consequently 
suffer from or are exposed to a multitude of preventable 
illnesses. 
Four health outcomes – diarrhoea, acute respiratory 
infections, undernutrition and soil-transmitted 
helminthiases – are included in the SDG indicator 3.9.2 on 
mortality attributed to unsafe WASH. It is estimated that 
1.4 million deaths in 2019 were attributable to unsafe
WASH services, of which the vast majority were 
attributable to diarrhoea (73.9%) and acute respiratory 
infections (25.4%) (10). The global WASH-attributable 
mortality rate was 18.3 deaths per 100 000 population, 
ranging from 3.7 in HICs up to 41.7 in LICs (10). Among the 
six WHO regions, the highest mortality rate was found in 
the African Region (46.7 per 100 000 population) and the 
South-East Asia Region (29.6 per 100 000 population) in 
2019 (11). These two regions alone accounted for 79% of 
the total global deaths due to unsafe WASH (Fig. 2.5).

2.2 Infectious diseases 
In the infectious disease section, the indicators on new 
HIV infections, tuberculosis and malaria incidence,

towards progress within SDG target 3.3. In addition, this 
section also presents the status of AMR. 
2.2.1 HIV
Globally, an estimated 39.9 million (UI: 36.1–44.6 million) 
people were living with HIV by the end of 2023, of 
which 30.7 million (UI: 27.0–31.9 million) were receiving 
lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (12,13).
In 2023, an estimated 1.3 million (UI: 1.0–1.7 million) HIV 
infections occurred, down from 2.8 million (UI: 2.3–
3.6 million) in 2000 and 2.1 million (UI: 1.7–2.7 million) 
in 2010. Globally, the HIV incidence rate (number of new 
HIV infections per 1000 uninfected population, SDG 
indicator 3.3.1) was 0.17 (UI: 0.13–0.21) in 2023, a 48% 
reduction from 0.32 (UI: 0.25–0.40) in 2010. Regions 
show different levels of progress since 2010: An 81% 
increase in HIV incidence rate was observed in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region, while it is notable that this 
region had the lowest number of new infections across 
all WHO regions in 2023. The South-East Asian and the 
African Regions recorded a 51% and 69% decrease in 
HIV incidence rate in the same time period, respectively, 
while the latter region continued to bear the heaviest HIV 
burden in 2023. Further disaggregation by sex show that 
the biggest reduction in HIV incidence rate between 2010 
and 2023 was among males in the African Region (–72%) 
(Fig. 2.6) (12,14,15).
The HIV pandemic and the global response has made 
progress over the past decade, with fewer people 
acquiring HIV in 2023 than at any point since the mid-
1990s. However, the number of new infections in 2023 
was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370 000 
or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target 
of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, which 
requires a 90% reduction in new infections against the 
2010 baseline, will not be reached (16).

2.2.2 Tuberculosis
The global increase in new TB cases that has been 
observed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
slowed and is now stabilizing. In 2023, an estimated 
10.8 million people (UI: 10.1–11.7 million) developed TB, 
a slight rise from 10.7 million (UI: 10.0–11.5 million) in 
2022. However, this remains higher than the 10.4 million 
(UI: 9.7–11.1 million) cases in 2021 and 10.1 million (UI: 
9.5–10.7 million) in 2020 (18). 
Among those affected who developed TB in 2023, some 
55% were men, 33% were women and 12% were children 
and young adolescents aged 0–14 years. Most of the
people who develop TB disease each year are in 30 high 
TB burden countries, accounting for 87% of the global 
total in 2023 (18).
The global TB incidence rate (SDG indicator 3.3.2) in 2023 
was 134 (UI: 125–145) per 100 000 population, similar to 
the rate in 2022, and an increase from 129 (UI: 121–136) 
per 100 000 population in 2020. The net reduction 
between 2015 and 2023 was 8.3%, falling short of the 
WHO End TB Strategy target of an 80% reduction by 
2030 (17,18). The African and European regions showed 
the most progress, with decreases of 24% and 27%, 
respectively (Fig. 2.7) (18).

2.2.3 Malaria
In 2023, there were an estimated 263 million (UI: 
238–294 million) malaria cases globally, an increase 
of 11 million cases from the previous year. The global 
incidence rate (SDG indicator 3.3.3) in 2023 was 60.4 (UI: 
54.8–67.5) cases per 1000 population at risk, a rise from 
58.6 (UI: 53.1–65.6) cases per 1000 population at risk in 
2022, and a 4.1% increase from 58.0 (UI: 53.8–62.9) cases 
per 1000 population at risk in 2015 (Fig. 2.8). The WHO 
African Region continues to carry the heaviest burden of 
the disease, accounting for an estimated 94% of cases 
and 95% of deaths worldwide in 2023 (19).
The Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 
(GTS) target for reducing malaria case incidence by 90% 
by 2030 from the 2015 baseline is unlikely to be achieved 
(20). In 2023, global malaria incidence remained nearly 
three times higher than the level required to meet the 
target. However, the WHO South-East Asia Region is on 
track to meet the GTS 2030 target (19).
Despite these challenges, some notable progress towards 
elimination has been made. The number of malaria￾endemic countries declined from 85 in 2022 to 83 in 2023, 
as two countries maintained zero indigenous cases for 
three consecutive years. By 2024, a total of 26 countries 
that were endemic for malaria in 2000 have achieved this 
milestone (19).

2.2.4 Hepatitis B 
As a major public health challenge of this decade, viral 
hepatitis B and C lead to chronic disease for hundreds of 
millions of people and can both cause deaths from liver 
cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Globally, 1.3 million people died from viral hepatitis￾related causes in 2022, including 1.1 million deaths 
attributed to hepatitis B alone. This represents an 
increase of deaths attributed to chronic hepatitis B from 
the 820 000 in 2019. The Western Pacific Region bears the 
greatest mortality burden, with 518 000 deaths (or 47.1 of 
the global total) related to hepatitis B (21). Rapid scale-up 
of treatment is therefore critical to prevent deaths among 
people living with chronic hepatitis B. Without this 
expansion in access, the world will face increasing cases 
of liver cancer in the next generation, with associated 
increasing care costs and hepatitis-related deaths.
In 2022, an estimated 254 million people were living with 
hepatitis B globally. About 5% of the general population 
in the WHO African Region and Western Pacific Region 
are living with hepatitis B. Children under the age of 
five are at risk of vertical (mother-to-child) transmission 
of hepatitis B, notably in settings with high hepatitis B 
prevalence. Notably, the African Region is the only region 
where the hepatitis B prevalence among children younger 
than five years (SDG indicator 3.3.4) exceeded 1% and 
yet only 17% of newborns in the Region receive the 
hepatitis B birth dose vaccination (22).
Health-related Sustainable Development Goals
31
Rate per 1000 population at risk
Global new infections of viral hepatitis dropped from 
3.0 million in 2019 to 2.2 million in 2022, including 
1.2 million newly infected with hepatitis B. The African 
Region accounted for 63% (or 771 000) of all new 
hepatitis B infections globally in 2022. This underscores 
the importance of a focus on scaling up access to viral 
hepatitis services in Africa, including the hepatitis B
 birth-dose vaccination, expansion of hepatitis B 
treatment in the general population and specifically 
among pregnant women as recently recommended in the 
2024 WHO guidelines on people with chronic hepatitis B 
infection (23).
2.2.5 Neglected tropical 
diseases
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of 
conditions with complex epidemiology.1
 They affect some 
of the world’s most vulnerable people, including those 
living in remote or impoverished communities, creating 
NTD-related generational cycles of poverty. Addressing 
the burden of NTDs can break this cycle and
1 NTDs include: Buruli ulcer; Chagas disease; dengue and chikungunya; dracunculiasis; echinococcosis; foodborne trematodiases; human African 
trypanosomiasis; leishmaniasis; leprosy; lymphatic filariasis; mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses; noma; onchocerciasis; rabies; scabies 
and other ectoparasitoses; schistosomiasis; soil-transmitted helminthiases; snakebite envenoming; taeniasis/cysticercosis; trachoma; and yaws.
contribute to the health, social and economic well-being 
of entire communities. Globally, in 2023, 1.495 billion 
people required interventions against NTDs (SDG 
indicator 3.3.5), about 122 million people fewer than in 
2022. The 2023 number represents a 32% decrease from 
2010, falling short of the global target of 90% reduction 
by 2030. The South-East Asia Region and the African 
Region, home to 41% of the global population, continue 
to disproportionately bear the highest burden of NTDs, 
accounting for 87% of the global number of people 
needing interventions in 2023 (Fig. 2.9) (24,25).
As of December 2024, 54 countries, areas and territories 
worldwide have eliminated at least one NTD, as 
acknowledged by WHO. This is still only about halfway 
towards the global target of at least 100 countries 
eliminating at least one NTD by 2030 (24,25).
This slow progress reflects the challenges of addressing 
NTDs on a global scale. Massive efforts, including 
through innovative solutions, are needed to accelerate 
progress in the global fight against NTDs, especially in 
the context of uncertain and evolving health, political and 
financial landscapes.

2.2.6 Antimicrobial resistance
SDG indicator 3.d.2 monitors the proportion of 
bloodstream infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant 
organisms, specifically Escherichia coli resistant to 
third-generation cephalosporins and methicillin￾resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In 2022, median 
resistance proportions were 45.5% (interquartile range 
[IQR]: 18.2–70.6) for E. coli and 32.2% (IQR: 12.5–54.6) for 
MRSA, up from 26.9% (IQR: 11.1–42.4) and 13.4% (IQR: 
3.6–36.7) in 2016 (27). 
These figures should be interpreted with caution due to 
changes in countries reporting data, with progressively 
more data collected from resource-limited settings 
over time. In 2016, only 16 countries reported data on 
E. coli resistance and 15 on MRSA, compared to 85 and 
86 countries, respectively, in 2022 (Fig. 2.10). Many LICs 
and MICs have limited testing coverage, often restricted 
to tertiary hospitals and research facilities, where patients 
are more likely to have received multiple antibiotics, 
leading to higher and potentially biased resistance rates. 
Countries with better testing coverage reported much 
lower resistance proportions in 2022: 11.4% (IQR: 9.4–
16.4) for E. coli and 8.5% (IQR: 3.3–27.9) for MRSA, based 
on median resistance from 21 and 22 countries with 
testing coverage above the 75th percentile, respectively 
(27). The 2024 WHO Bacterial Priority Pathogen List 
(26) classifies E. coli resistant to third-generation 
cephalosporins as a critical priority due to increasing 
trends, while MRSA is considered as high priority based 
on its prevalence and impact in health-care settings, and 
decreasing trends. 
Current global AMR data reflect the challenges of early￾stage surveillance systems. Strengthening these systems, 
particularly in LICs and MICs, is essential for improving 
data accuracy and representativeness to inform 
interventions to prevent and reduce AMR. The Global 
Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System 
(GLASS) dashboard (27) provides more information on the 
current AMR situation in the human health sector.

of developing a disease or injury. This section presents 
progress towards achieving the SDG targets related to 
nutritional, behavioural and environmental risk factors 
that may affect individual and population health.
2.3.1 Nutritional risk factors
Multisectoral factors affect the nutritional status of 
individuals and populations. Mitigating the risks of 
malnutrition – manifested as undernutrition (wasting, 
stunting, underweight), micronutrient-related conditions, 
overweight and obesity – requires multifaceted 
approaches through nutrition-specific (e.g. food, 
diet) and nutrition-sensitive strategies (e.g. WASH, 
education, gender). In fact, undernutrition and food 
safety are inextricably linked and comprise the essential 
components of a healthy and sustainable food system. 
The following sections present the latest available 
estimates for the global SDG indicators for stunting, 
wasting and overweight among children under 5 years of 
age, and anaemia in women aged 15–49 years. 
Child malnutrition
The indicators to monitor progress in reducing child 
malnutrition among children under 5 years of age 
include the prevalence of stunting (SDG indicator 2.2.1), 
and the prevalence of wasting and overweight (SDG 
indicator 2.2.2).
The global prevalence of stunting among children under 
5 years of age had been steadily declining from 33.1% 
(UI: 32.7–33.5%) in 2000 to 22.4% (UI: 22.0–22.8%) in 
2020 but had slightly increased since to reach 23.2% (UI: 
22.6–23.8%) in 2024 (Fig. 2.11) (28).
The number of children affected by stunting worldwide 
fell from 180 million in 2012 to 150 million in 2024 
(Fig. 2.11) – a net reduction of 17% over the period (28). 
This pace of reduction is insufficient to achieve the global 
target of halving the number of children affected by 
stunting by 2030 from the 2012 baseline (28,29).
Similarly, the world is off track to reach the target of 
reducing the prevalence of wasting and overweight to 
less than 3% each by 2030 (Fig. 2.12) (29). In 2024, the 
global prevalence of wasting among children under 
5 years of age stood at 6.6% (UI: 5.3–8.1%), having 
declined by 11% since 2012, when the prevalence was 
7.4% (UI: 6.3–8.7%) (28). 
While there was a sign of slight decline in the global 
prevalence of overweight among children under 5 years 
of age in the 2010s, it has slightly increased again since 
2020 to reach 5.5% (UI: 4.9–6.1%) in 2024. Between 2012 
and 2024, there was a net increase of 3% in the global 
prevalence of overweight, necessitating a reversal of 
trend and an acceleration of progress to meet the 2030 
target (28).

Prevalence (%)
Number affected (millions)
Prevalence (%)
Anaemia among women 
Anaemia is an important global health issue mainly 
affecting young children, menstruating girls and 
women, and pregnant and postpartum women. It can 
affect school performance and productivity in adult life 
leading to economic losses. During pregnancy, anaemia 
has been associated with poor maternal and birth 
outcomes. 
The global prevalence of anaemia among all women 
15–49 years of age (SDG indicator 2.2.3) declined 
marginally from 29.3% (UI: 26.4–32.4%) in 2000 to 27.6% 
(UI: 25.3–29.7%) in 2012 but slightly increased since to 
reach 30.7% (UI: 26.6–34.9%) in 2023 (Fig. 2.13). At this 
rate, the world is off track to meet the target of 50% 
reduction by 2030 (from a 2012 baseline) (29,30).
Among pregnant women globally, the prevalence 
decreased from 40.3% (UI: 37.7–43.2%) in 2000 to 35.3% 
(UI: 33.3–37.3%) in 2012, however, it remained stagnant 
since. In 2023, the prevalence was 35.5% (UI: 32.1–
39.1%). By contrast, prevalence among non-pregnant 
women only decreased slightly from 28.7% (UI: 25.7–
31.9%) in 2000 to 27.1% (UI: 24.9–29.4%) in 2012 and 
increased to 30.5% (UI: 26.2–34.8%) in 2023. 
Regional trends in the prevalence of anaemia among all 
women 15–49 years of age indicate a slight increase in 
all WHO regions since 2012 except in the Western Pacific 
Region, where it has remained unchanged (Fig. 2.13). 
The South-East Asia Region shows the highest level of 
anaemia since 2000. In 2023, anaemia affected almost 
half (46.4%, UI: 35.5–56.1%) of all women aged 15–49 
years in the region.
2.3.2 Behavioural risk factors 
Among the established risk factors associated with NCDs 
are modifiable behaviours such as tobacco use, alcohol 
consumption, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet. 
This section summarizes the global progress towards 
the reduction of tobacco use and alcohol consumption.
Tobacco use 
Tobacco use is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases, different types of cancer and many 
other debilitating health conditions. There is no safe 
level of exposure to tobacco, and all forms of tobacco 
are harmful.
In 2022, an estimated 1.25 billion persons aged 15 years 
and older globally were current tobacco users. This 
corresponds to an age-standardized prevalence (SDG 
indicator 3.a.1) of 20.9% (UI: 18.8–22.9%), a 21% relative 
decline from 26.4% in 2010. If this pace of decline is 
maintained, the global prevalence would be reduced 
by 25% by 2025, short of the 30% reduction target. 
Nevertheless, the African Region and the South-East 
Asia Region are currently on track to achieve the target, 
and other regions have also achieved reductions in 
average prevalence (31,32).

Prevalence (%)
Prevalence remained much higher among men than 
women globally. In 2022, there were four times as many 
male tobacco users as female users among those aged 15 
years and older. The prevalence among female tobacco 
users fell by 34% between 2010 and 2022, exceeding even 
the 2025 global target. Among male users, prevalence 
has so far declined by only 17%. However, the fastest 
reduction among male tobacco users was seen in the 
“initiation ages” (age group 15–24 years), a 20% relative 
reduction since 2010, which bodes well for continuing 
reductions in prevalence of tobacco use among men in 
the future (31). 
Alcohol consumption
Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing 
NCDs such as liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases and 
different types of cancers, as well as mental health and 
behavioural conditions such as depression, anxiety and 
alcohol use disorders. Alcohol consumption also causes 
significant harm to others, as it can lead to injuries 
such as those caused by road traffic crashes. The Global 
alcohol action plan 2022–2030 includes a target of at least 
a 20% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol by 
2030 (in comparison with 2010) (33).
SDG indicator 3.5.2 is defined as total alcohol per capita 
consumption (APC) in persons aged 15 years and older 
within a calendar year, measured in litres of pure alcohol. 
Globally, the total APC declined by 12% from 5.7 litres (UI: 
5.4–6.2) in 2010 to 5.0 litres (UI: 4.7–5.4) in 2022. If this rate 
of reduction is maintained, the global total APC will reach 
4.6 litres in 2030, reaching the 20% reduction target. This 
is remarkable progress, especially given that in the early 
2010s the global total APC was increasing, continuing the 
upward trend since 2000s, driven mainly by the rise in 
total APC in the South-East Asia Region and the Western 
Pacific Region (Fig. 2.14) (34).
The South-East Asia Region has curbed the rise and 
the APC level in 2022 had returned to its 2010 level. The 
Western Pacific Region has reversed the trend and is 
now on track to reach 20% reduction in APC by 2030. The 
Eastern Mediterranean Region has remained the region 
with the lowest APC across all regions. The European 
Region continues to have the highest total APC, although 
it has declined by 12% since 2010 (Fig. 2.14) (34).

risk factors
Water, sanitation and hygiene
Safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is 
crucial to human health and well-being. Contaminated 
water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission 
of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, 
hepatitis A, typhoid and polio.
The global coverage of safely managed drinking water 
(SDG indicator 6.1.1) increased from 69% in 2015 to 73% 
in 2022. During the same period, the global coverage 
of safely managed sanitation (SDG indicator 6.2.1) rose 
from 49% to 57% and that of basic hygiene services (SDG 
indicator 6.2.1) increased from 67% to 75%. Despite this 
progress, if current trends continue the world will not 
achieve universal coverage of safe WASH by 2030 (35).
Globally, and in all WHO regions with aggregate data for 
2022, coverage of safe WASH is higher in urban areas than 
in rural areas, except in the South-East Asia Region, where 
the coverage of both safely managed drinking water 
and safely managed sanitation was higher in rural areas 
(Fig. 2.15) (35).

SDG indicator 6.3.1 monitors the proportion of total, 
domestic and industrial wastewater flows that are safely 
treated. Many countries, however, are at an early stage 
of developing wastewater monitoring systems and 
there is currently a lack of reporting, especially from 
industrial sources. Among the 73 countries (representing 
42% of the global population) reporting volumes of 
total wastewater generated and treated, 76% of total 
wastewater flows received some level of treatment in 
2022. Among the 42 countries (representing 12% of 
global population) reporting the type of treatment, 60% 
of total wastewater flows was “safely” treated (i.e. had at 
least secondary treatment, or treatment complying with 
relevant standards) (36). An estimated 56% of household 
wastewater was safely treated in 2024, based on data 
from 142 countries and areas (representing 88% of all 
household wastewater flows and 84% of the global 
population) (37). While current data are insufficient to 
accurately assess progress since the start of the SDG 
era (mainly due to the lack of baseline data for 2015), 
data availability has greatly improved. Still, there is 
little evidence of improvements in the proportion of 
wastewater that is safely treated globally since global 
reporting began in 2021. 
Official development assistance (ODA) disbursements to 
the water sector (SDG indicator 6.a.1) declined slightly 
from US$ 8.9 billion in 2022 to US$ 8.7 billion in 2023, 
however they remained higher than disbursements in 
2020 and 2021, which had the lowest levels since the 
start of the SDGs in 2015. ODA commitments to the water 
sector decreased more substantially, from US$ 11.4 billion 
in 2022 to US$ 10.2 billion in 2023 (38).
Air pollution
Air pollution, both indoor and outdoor (ambient), poses 
major risks to health. The main pathway of exposure to 
air pollution is through the respiratory tract. However, 
the effects on health extend beyond respiratory diseases, 
as some air pollutants can penetrate the bloodstream 
via the lungs and circulate throughout the entire body 
leading to systemic inflammation and carcinogenicity.
Simple stoves paired with charcoal, coal, crop waste, 
dung, kerosene or wood are an important source of 
household air pollution. The latest estimates reveal that 
2.1 billion (UI: 1.9–2.5 billion) people worldwide were still 
relying on these polluting cooking fuels and technologies 
in 2023 – equivalent to slightly over a quarter (26%, UI: 
23–30%) of the global population. The proportion of the 
global population with primary reliance on clean cooking 
fuels and technologies had increased from 49% (UI: 
45–53%) in 2000 to 64% (UI: 60–68%) in 2015 and 74% (UI: 
70–77%) in 2023 (Fig. 2.16) (39). Under current trends, the 
world will miss the target of universal access by 2030.

In terms of ambient air pollution, SDG indicator 
11.6.2 tracks the annual average concentration of fine 
particulate matter in urban areas. Globally, air quality 
levels for particulate matter are still more than six times 
the recommended level for protecting public health 
according to the WHO air quality guidelines, which is set 
at the annual mean of 5 μg/m3. Nearly all populations 
in HICs, LICs and MICs are exposed to unsafe levels of air 
pollution. However, the proportion of population in LICs 
and MICs exposed to levels above the interim target 4 
(annual mean of 10 μg/m3
) is twice that in HICs, at 93.5% 
and 47.1%, respectively. The proportion of population in 
LICs and MICs exposed to levels exceeding interim target 
1 (annual mean of 35 μg/m3) is over 10 times that in 
HICs (42.0% and 3.7%, respectively). In addition, people 
living in LICs and MICs are less likely to have air quality 
standards that can protect them. The recent publication 
of the WHO air quality standard database shows that 
only 32% of LICs and MICs (17 countries) have annual fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) standards while 76% of HICs 
(44 countries) have such protective standards (40).
2.3.4 Risks to girls’ and 
women’s health
Adolescent pregnancy
Adolescent pregnancy is a worldwide issue with 
significant health, social and economic impacts. Teenage 
mothers aged 10–19 years face higher risks of eclampsia, 
puerperal endometritis and systemic infections than 
women aged 20–24 years, and babies of teenage mothers 
face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm birth and 
severe neonatal conditions.
The global adolescent birth rate (ABR; SDG indicator 
3.7.2) among girls aged 15–19 years declined by 17%, 
from 45.9 births per 1000 girls in 2015 to 38.3 births per 
1000 girls in 2024. The global ABR among girls aged 
10–14 years fell at almost double the rate, with a 31% 
decline from 1.5 births per 1000 girls in 2015 to 1.0 birth 
per 1000 girls in 2024. While this decline is encouraging, 
there were still far too many births among adolescent 
mothers in 2024, accounting for about 9.4% of all births 
globally (41).
Progress is uneven among regions (Fig. 2.17), as well 
as among and within countries. The African Region 
continued to have the highest ABR in both adolescent age 
groups (10–14 years and 15–19 years). In 2024, the ABR 
among girls aged 15–19 years was 90.5 births per 1000 
girls, over eight times that of the region with the lowest 
ABR, the Western Pacific Region. The gaps in ABR among 
girls aged 10–14 years were even larger: at 3.0 births per 
1000 girls, it was 35 times that of the regions with the 
lowest ABR, the European Region. By region and age 
group, the biggest relative reduction in ABR occurred in 
the South-East Asia Region, where ABR among girls aged 
10–14 years fell by 61%, from 0.8 births per 1000 girls in 
2015 to 0.3 births per 1000 girls in 2024 (41).

Violence against women
Violence against women and girls – particularly intimate 
partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence – is a violation 
of human rights and a major public health problem. 
Such violence often has devastating impacts on the lives 
and well-being of the victims, as well as their children 
and families.
According to the latest available global estimates, in 
2018 over a quarter (26%, UI: 22–30%) of ever-partnered 
women aged 15 years or older had experienced IPV at 
least once in their lifetime (SDG indicator 5.2.1) and 10% 
(UI: 8–12%) in the past 12 months (42). There has been 
insufficient progress in reducing IPV against women and 
girls since 2000 (43).
In 2018, an estimated 6% (UI: 4–9%) of all women globally 
had been subjected to non-partner sexual violence in 
their lifetime since the age of 15 (SDG indicator 5.2.2). The 
true prevalence is likely to be much higher (42). 
Population-based surveys which record survivors’ 
responses provide the best information to measure 
prevalence of IPV and sexual violence. However, even 
such surveys often have limitations, such as variations 
in case definitions and recall periods, stigma and 
repercussions associated with the disclosure of violence 
against women, and limited data collection from women 
aged 50 years and older.
2.4 Universal health coverage and 
health systems
2 Service coverage indicators (scale of 0–100) with a global baseline of 2000 and a latest available of 2019 or later. 
Universal health coverage aims to ensure that all 
individuals and communities have access to the quality 
health services they need without suffering financial 
hardship. When more people have access to affordable 
quality health services, it leads to better overall public 
health and living standards, including, but not limited 
to, improved life expectancy, lower rates of preventable 
diseases and lower rates of poverty due to medical costs. 
2.4.1 Service delivery
To achieve UHC and improve health outcomes, health 
systems need strong service delivery mechanisms that 
ensure comprehensive service coverage, a capable 
health workforce and adherence to international 
health regulations (IHRs) to address both routine and 
emergency health needs.
Service coverage
While gains in UHC service coverage index (UHC SCI; SDG 
indicator 3.8.1) have been observed globally over the past 
two decades, progress has slowed in recent years (44). 
The UHC SCI is composed of 14 tracer indicators selected 
as a manageable subset to represent overall coverage. 
These indicators are organized into four domains: 
reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health 
(RMNCH); infectious diseases; NCDs; and service capacity 
and access. 
The progress made in the UHC SCI has not been even 
across domains (44). Figure 2.18 shows the change since 
2000 in UHC SCI and selected tracers or related health 
SDG service coverage indicators.2 Globally, service 
coverage tracer indicators improved by a range of 3–75 
percentage points from 2000 to the latest available year 
(2019–2024). There remains significant scope for progress 
in the area of NCDs, which contribute to the largest 
proportion of disease burden globally. Hypertension and 
diabetes treatment coverage (age-standardized) remains 
below 50% of the target population globally (42% and 
40% in 2019 and 2022, respectively) and progress needs 
to be accelerated (14,15,18,31,35,44–48).

reproductive age having their need for family planning 
met with modern methods (SDG indicator 3.7.1) has seen 
a modest improvement of an average of 1.2 percentage 
points in the each of the last two decades globally, with 
no WHO region reaching universal coverage (range 
58.1–87.3%) in 2024 (47). The global proportion of births 
attended by skilled health personnel (SDG indicator 3.1.2) 
increased by 26 percentage points between 2000 and 
2024, to 87%. As of 2024, the WHO Region of the Americas

universal or nearly universal coverage, while only 74% of 
births are attended by a medical doctor, nurse or midwife

2023 vaccination rates had still not fully returned to 
their 2019 pre-pandemic level, suggesting substantial 
residual dysfunction in global vaccine delivery systems. 
Vaccination rates for the other three vaccines increased, 
although this was partially due to new introductions. 
3 Diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP3), measles-containing-vaccine second-dose (MCV2), pneumococcal conjugate 3rd dose (PCV3) and human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccine.
Globally, DTP3 still has the highest coverage of the four 
vaccines, at 84% in 2023. 
The WHO Region of the Americas has the highest 
coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination 
among girls aged 9–14 years, reaching 55% within 
18 years of introduction of the vaccine. However, globally 
HPV coverage remains low, meaning millions of girls 
will remain susceptible to cervical cancer over their 
lifetimes. Among WHO regions, the European Region 
has the highest uptake of third dose pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV3), with coverage at 86% in 2023. 
In 2023, the WHO European and Western Pacific Regions 
had DTP3 and measles-containing-vaccine second-dose 
(MCV2) coverage of 90% or higher, and the South-East 
Asia Region reached 90% for DTP3 (48). However, the 90% 
global target set by the Immunization Agenda is unlikely 
to be met for any of these vaccinations if current trends 
continue (50).
Data collected from about 20 countries between 2015

drug use are risk factors for multiple health conditions, 
such as cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, cancer,

all of which contribute to NCD-related morbidity and

Surveys are essential for gathering population health 
data, including, but not limited to, fertility rates, nutrition, 
child health and disease prevalence. The data collected 
by surveys support informing health policy, improving 
health systems and identifying emerging health issues 
(see Box 2.1).
Box 2.1 Demographic and Health Surveys in universal health coverage service 
coverage index (UHC SCI)
Over half of the UHC SCI tracers use surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) as a data source. 
The DHS programme was initiated in the early 1980s by the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) with the aim of providing countries with reliable and timely data on critical health and demographic 
indicators. It aimed to fill a gap in data collection, particularly in developing countries where such information 
was often lacking or outdated. The first survey was conducted in El Salvador in 1985. Since 2000, there have been 
around 300 DHS conducted (see Fig. 2.19) (53). The suspension of USAID funding delays crucial public health data, 
resulting in the short-term in an evidence gap to allocate resources and develop policies. Without immediate 
actions to replace this data collection, the evidence gap will lead to less effective health interventions and 
widening health disparities. As statistical offices and ministries of health develop a strategy to mitigate the loss 
of the DHS, other questionnaires such as the WHO World Health Survey Plus (54) can guide comprehensive data 
collection to monitor progress towards population health targets and health-related SDGs.

Health workforce
Health workers are crucial for achieving UHC. Their role 
goes beyond providing medical care: an ample, well￾trained and properly distributed workforce ensures that 
health services are accessible, effective and of good 
quality for all, regardless of income or place of residence.
The estimated global stock of health workers exceeds 
70 million in 2023, with the five occupations included 
in SDG target 3.c (dentists, medical doctors, midwifery 
personnel, nursing personnel and pharmacists) 
accounting for 52 million (55). Data for 2023 show a 26% 
increase in the density of dentists, medical doctors, 
midwifery personnel, nursing personnel and pharmacists 
since 2013, but with significant differences by region and 
income group (for instance, on average, 1 for every 64 
people in HICs versus 1 for every 621 people in LICs) (56).
The estimated global shortage of 15.4 million health 
workers in 2020 decreased to 14.7 million in 2023. The 
projected 2030 shortage of 11.1 million shows slow 
progress in closing the gap (Fig. 2.20), with the WHO 
African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions projected 
to bear nearly 70% of the shortage. HICs and upper￾middle-income countries (UMICs), which account for 
53% of the global population and 80% of workers in the 
five occupations under SDG target 3.c, have the highest 
densities of health workers. Nevertheless, these countries 
will likely need to recruit 8.4 million additional health 
workers by 2030 to maintain density levels and meet 
the rising demands of growing and ageing populations, 
potentially accelerating international migration of 
health workers.

International health regulations
IHRs are essential to service delivery as they ensure 
countries have the necessary capacities within their 
health systems to prevent, prepare, detect in a timely 
manner and respond to public health emergencies. 
IHRs therefore contribute to global health resilience and 
the achievement of sustainable health outcomes for 
all populations.
IHRs States Parties self-assessment annual reporting tool 
(SPAR) second edition (57), which assesses 15 capacities, 
was launched in 2021 and is in its fourth year of reporting. 
Globally, the capacities average (SDG target 3.d.1) has 
wavered around 64% between 2021 and 2024. The three 
main achievement and challenges capacities measured 
by SPAR (Fig. 2.21) have changed minimally (1 point) 
globally, with the exception of challenge C1 (Policy, legal 
and normative instruments to implement IHR), which 
improved by 3 points globally and by 11 in the South-East 
Asia Region. The WHO African Region improved its score 
(from 2 to 6 points) in all three main challenges and two 
of the achievements between 2021 and 2024 (58).

2.4.2 Health financing
Sustainable, efficient and effective health financing 
is critical for achieving UHC. By pooling resources, 
reducing out-of-pocket payments and ensuring financial 
protection, health financing allows countries to provide 
equitable access to quality health care for all populations.
Financial protection
The financial protection dimension of UHC is achieved 
when there are no financial barriers to accessing needed 
health services and goods, and out-of-pocket (OOP) 
health spending is not a source of financial hardship. 
SDG indicator 3.8.2 measures the proportion of people 
experiencing catastrophic OOP health spending. The 
latest data show that the global proportion of the 
population spending more than 10% of their household 
budget on health OOP increased from 2000 to 2019, 
reaching 13.5%, while the global proportion of the 
population spending more than 25% reached 3.8%.
It is also important to track how many people are 
impoverished or further impoverished by OOP health 
spending, as even relatively small OOP payments can 
threaten the living standards of people living near or in 
poverty. In 2019, some 344 million people were pushed 
or further pushed into extreme poverty by OOP health 
spending, while 13.5% of the global population spent 
more than 10% of their household budget on OOP 
payments for health. The proportion of people facing 
impoverishing OOP spending at the extreme poverty 
line declined from 22.2% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2019. In 
contrast, the share at the relative poverty line rose from 
11.8% in 2000 to 16.7% in 2019 (Fig. 2.22). These trends 
suggest that while OOP health spending was less likely 
to push people into extreme poverty by 2019, it still 
disproportionately affected those in the lower income 
brackets (44).

Domestic and international funding
Domestic public funds provide long-term sustainability, 
equity and a foundation for health systems, while 
international funds address funding gaps, support global 
initiatives and bring innovation to health care delivery. 
The increase in the prioritization of health within general 
government spending seen in 2020 and 2021 (the health 
component of SDG indicator 1.a.2) among middle￾and high-income groups was not sustained in 2022, 
and even declined slightly in LICs, LMICs and UMICs. 
However, the share of health expenditure within total 
government spending remained higher in 2022 than in 
2019 in all income groups (59). Government funding is 
essential to subsidize health services and ensure they 
are affordable for everyone, including low-income or 
vulnerable populations.
Development assistance to medical research is vital for 
addressing both emerging health challenges and 
ongoing diseases, particularly in LICs and MICs, where the 
basic health portion addresses fundamental health-care 
needs that are critical to UHC. In 2023, LICs received the 
highest weighted average ODA per capita (SDG indicator 
3.b.2), at US$ 6.04, compared with US$ 0.88 and US$ 0.43 
for the LMICs and UMICs, respectively. However, ODA 
varies significantly by country; the five countries with 
the highest per capita ODA are mostly island states in the 
middle- and high-income groupings (60).
Since the global indicator framework for SDGs was 
agreed in 2017 (61), challenges including the rising 
burden of NCDs, the impact of global health crises like the 
COVID-19 pandemic, workforce shortages and financial 
sustainability, have increased. Indicators used to monitor 
UHC need to adapt to the changing world, improvements 
in data availability and understanding of populations 
being left behind (Box 2.2).

Box 2.2 Revising SDGs to improve monitoring of progress towards UHC 
Together, SDG indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are essential to monitoring progress towards UHC: 3.8.1 aims to assess 
whether needed services are available and used by those in need, while 3.8.2 assesses whether people are 
financially burdened by the cost of care. The two indicators were revised as part of the Inter-Agency and Expert 
Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators 2025 comprehensive review (62) and approved by United 
Nations Statistical Commission in March 2025 (63).
The revision of SDG indicator 3.8.1 follows the same principals as its original construction (64) but aims to update 
to indicators with improved data availability for better tracking and alignment with existing SDG indicators. The 
tracers were selected as a subset of overall coverage and all equally contribute to the UHC SCI. The revision will 
apply weights based on the population affected by each tracer to better reflect the service burden on a health 
system; the four domain areas will still equally contribute to the overall SCI.
The revision of SDG indicator 3.8.2 captures financial hardship caused by both substantial and impoverishing 
OOP health spending. Initially, the budget share definition was retained for SDG indicator 3.8.2, with a 10% 
threshold used to identify large OOP spending. This was intended to identify hardship in poorer populations. 
However, global monitoring reports on UHC have shown that many people living in poverty, who spend less 
than 10% of their household budget on health, are still pushed or further pushed into extreme or relative 
poverty. The revised indicator is defined as the proportion of the population with OOP household expenditure 
on health exceeding 40% of the household discretionary budget. A household’s discretionary budget is defined 
as household total consumption expenditure or income net of the societal poverty line (SPL). The SPL is used to 
assess the cost of basic needs across countries at all income levels. The discretionary budget approach takes 
into account that poorer households allocate most of their resources to necessities and in effect can spend very 
little on health OOP without struggling financially, while wealthier households can spend much more before OOP 
spending leads to financial hardship. 
These revisions align with the SDG principle of ensuring no one is left behind and aim to better reflect the 
realities of service coverage and financial hardship across countries. The new definitions will be reflected in the 
next Tracking universal health coverage: global monitoring report (65) to be published at the end of 2025.
2.5 SDG progress to date
As the world moves closer to 2030, progress is insufficient 
to meet the health-related SDG and other global targets. 
While there have been improvements for most of the 
indicators reviewed in this chapter, only one – reducing 
alcohol consumption – is on track to meet the 2030 target 
at the global level. The assessment of progress in selected 
health-related SDG indicators by WHO region is presented 
in Annex 1. Concerted efforts are needed to accelerate 
progress and reverse regressing trends globally, as well 
as at regional, country and community levels.

Progress in 
achieving the 
Triple Billion 
targets
The Triple Billion targets, a cornerstone of WHO’s Thirteenth General 
Programme of Work (GPW13), track the collective progress by WHO 
and its Member States in promoting, providing and protecting health 
worldwide. The latest update illustrates the progress made since 
the start of GPW13 in 2018 and the key challenges particularly in the 
universal health coverage and health emergencies protection billions. 
Anchored in the health-related SDGs, WHO’s GPW13 
provides a strategic roadmap to enhance health and well￾being for all (1). More importantly, GPW13 championed 
the results framework with impact measurement at 
its core to reinforce organizational accountability and 
transparency. The foundation of the impact measurement 
is the 46 outcome indicators centred on promoting the 
overall health and quality of life for the people, providing 
essential health services, and protecting people from 
health emergencies. The Triple Billion targets give 
strategic clarity to the impact measurement of GPW13. 
By summarizing the outcome indicators into three 
ambitious, but easy to understand and communicate 
goals, the Triple Billion targets effectively convey global 
health priorities, motivate collective action by the global
community, facilitate transparency and accountability, 
and complement the strategic priorities set by WHO’s 
GPW13 to address current and emerging global 
health priorities.
For GPW13, the WHO Member States aim to enable one 
billion more people achieve better health and overall 
well-being, to provide one billion more people with 
access to essential health services without incurring 
financial hardship, and to better protect one billion more 
people from health emergencies worldwide by the end 
of the GPW13, extended from 2023 to 2025. This chapter 
provides a summary of the progress made in achieving 
the Triple Billion targets with projections to 2025, 
incorporating the latest available data from the outcome 
indicators at the country level.
3.1 Triple Billion targets progress
Progress towards achieving the Triple Billion targets 
remains uneven (Fig. 3.1). Growth in providing essential 
health services is insufficient, with only 431 million 
more people gaining affordable health-care access by 
2024 relative to the GPW13 baseline year of 2018. This 
is projected to rise to 500 million by 2025 – half the 
targeted one billion. Furthermore, close to 637 million 
more individuals will be better protected from health 
emergencies by 2024. Despite significant progress, this is 
expected only to increase to 697 million people by 2025, 
around 30% short of the one-billion target. Remarkably, 
an estimated 1.4 billion more people will experience 
healthier lives by 2024, with 1.5 billion expected in 2025, 
surpassing the original target of one billion. Yet, such 
progress is not enough to put the world on track to 
achieve the health-related SDGs by 2030 (2,3). Moreover, 
recent interruptions in international aid threaten to 
disrupt health services and systems, disproportionally 
impacting countries and communities with the greatest 
health-care needs. Safeguarding the gains made in 
achieving the Triple Billion targets is a paramount task for 
the global community in the years ahead.

3.2 Progress in 
healthier populations
Current trends indicate that the world is on track to meet 
the goal of improving health and well-being for one 
more billion people by 2025. Compared with the baseline 
year of 2018, some 1.5 billion people are projected to be 
living healthier lives by 2025. Such progress is primarily 
due to reduced tobacco use, improved air quality, 
increased use of clean household fuels, and better access 
to water, sanitation and hygiene (Fig. 3.1). Yet, at the 
global level, significant challenges persist in the areas of 
rising rates of adult and childhood obesity.
Looking at the top contributing indicators by region 
(Fig. 3.2), the most striking features are worsening 
rates of adult obesity in the Easter Mediterranean 
Region and Region of the Americas. These account for 
setbacks equal to 32.5% and 62.1% of the respective 
regional net contributions. Despite these difficulties, 
substantial progress has been made. Most regions are 
seeing improvements in clean household fuel use as their 
primary marker of progress, with particularly large effects 
in the African Region (67.6%) and the South-East Asia 
Region (53.1%). In both these regions, improvements in 
clean fuel use represent over half of the additional people 
living healthier lives.
All regions showed substantial progress in safely 
managed sanitation, which ranked as the second most 
important contributor globally (32.7%). The top three 
indicators contributing to the Triple Billion targets in 
the European Region are improvements in air quality 
(38.4%), safely managed sanitation (26.1%) and tobacco 
use (22.8%). The African Region is unique in having 
safely managed water as a top contributor (14.9%), 
highlighting region-specific priorities and challenges in 
water infrastructure.

3.3 Progress in universal 
health coverage
Compared with the baseline year of 2018, about 
500 million more people worldwide will enjoy access 
to essential health services without undue financial 
burden by 2025. This progress in achieving UHC has 
been supported by improvements in health workforce, 
enhanced coverage of hypertension treatment, and 
better access to family planning. However, the most 
substantial contributor to achieving UHC, and the 
progress made so far during the GPW13 period, is 
the expanded availability of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) for HIV and AIDS. Challenges in access to health 
services continue to hinder faster progress, particularly 
in diabetes management and mitigating financial 
hardships incurred by utilizing health services. 
The declining coverage of DTP3 immunization is 
especially concerning.
Nearly all regions have seen progress in expanding 
access to HIV treatment (Fig. 3.2). However, there 
have been setbacks in progress in health security and 
affordability. In the Region of the Americas, the strong 
progress is substantially offset by deterioration in health 
security (–42.2%). Both the European and Western Pacific 
regions have seen significant increases in financial 
hardship. Rising financial hardship in the Western Pacific 
Region has significantly offset other UHC improvements, 
reducing progress by nearly 30%.
Most regions show contributions from multiple factors, 
indicating diverse approaches to managing health-care 
access. We see smaller, yet still substantial, gains in the 
health workforce in the Western Pacific Region (23.1%), 
as well as better tuberculosis treatment in the South-East 
Asia (17%) and Eastern Mediterranean regions (7.5%).
3.4 Progress in health 
emergencies protection
According to updated information for the outcome 
indicators, substantial advancements have been made 
towards better safeguarding an additional one billion 
people from health emergencies by 2025. Crucial 
amendments to the International Health Regulations, 
adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2024, represent 
a major step forward in global health security and 
pandemic preparedness. In addition, significant strides in 
early disease detection, mobilizing emergency response 
teams and ensuring equitable access to essential 
medical supplies, are key drivers of global resilience to 
health emergencies.
Health emergencies protection shows the greatest 
amount of regional variation in top indicator 
contributions (Fig. 3.2). The Eastern Mediterranean 
Region reported exceptional progress in detection 
and response times (151.4%) but was undermined by 
worsening health security (–83.8%). Meanwhile, the 
Region of the Americas faces challenges in both health 
security (–94.9%) and prevention (–60.3%). The European 
Region made strong gains in detection and response, 
with a positive profile across indices (92% time to detect 
and respond, 7.8% health security). These contrasting 
outcomes highlight regional differences in emergency 
preparedness and response strategies.

3.5 Forecast to 2030 and scenarios
The Triple Billion target projections through 2030 
showed encouraging trends towards a healthier global 
population. Under the current trajectory, 2.0 billion more 
people were expected to live healthier by 2030 compared 
with the 2018 baseline. Figure 3.3 presents an alternative 
scenario in which all countries meet the annualized 
targets set by the 2030 Agenda using the same set of 
46 outcome indicators (4). In this case, 5.6 billion more 
people would live healthier lives by 2030 – nearly triple 
the gain of 2.0 billion under the current trajectory. 
Similarly, achieving the 2030 SDG and other global 
targets would result in 2.1 billion more people gaining 
access to UHC without financial hardship, compared with 
0.8 billion under current trends. The gap is smaller for 
health emergency protection; meeting the 2030 targets 
would still safeguard 1.0 billion more people against 
health emergencies, compared with 0.8 billion under the 
current trajectory.
Figure 3.4 illustrates the potential for additional progress 
if within-region inequalities were to be addressed. It
shows the gap between forecasted contributions and 
a scenario where all countries are able to match their 
regional top performers by 2030. The large gaps highlight 
significant missed opportunities in progress both now 
and in the future.
The regional disparities are most striking for health 
emergencies protection. By 2030, an additional 30.6% 
of people in the Region of the Americas could be better 
protected if all countries matched their regional leaders – 
a sharp increase from 10.6% in 2025. Similarly, the African 
Region could extend protection to an additional 28% of 
its population, up from 9.6% in 2025.
For UHC, closing these gaps would mean an additional 
13.8% of people in the European Region and over 15.5% 
more people in the Region of the Americas would have 
affordable access to essential health care. These figures 
underscore how reducing within-region disparities 
could dramatically accelerate progress toward the Triple 
Billion targets.

Box 3.1 Transition from GPW13 to GPW14
The WHO GPW13 (2019–2023, extended to 2025), strengthened WHO’s effectiveness and accountability in 
improving global health outcomes. Triple Billion targets, a key component of GPW13, were designed to enhance 
accountability and drive measurable health improvements worldwide. By strategically focusing on three target 
areas and leveraging existing data sources, WHO aimed to deliver tangible health benefits to billions of people.
In September 2023, the United Nations Heads of State and Government Meeting called for doubling the 
rate of progress on the SDGs to meet the 2030 Agenda (5). In response, WHO is developing the fourteenth 
general programme of work (GPW14, 2025–2028) to address two fundamental challenges: slow progress and 
insufficient data.
Building on GPW13, GPW14 focuses on promoting, providing and protecting health while strengthening 
the global health ecosystem to advance the SDGs. Additionally, it seeks to enhance WHO’s organizational 
performance across all three levels – global, regional and country.
The GPW14 results framework translates health goals into measurable targets through a structured results 
chain. This chain links WHO’s work to broader health and development outcomes. As in GPW13, progress will be 
assessed using the Triple Billion indices through outcome indicators in three overarching areas: promote, provide 
and protect.
Triple Billion targets recalibration
Under GPW13, the Triple Billion targets for 2025 were defined in terms of relative changes – the additional 
number of people who achieved specific health status compared to 2018:
• 1 billion more people living healthier lives (promote)
• 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage (provide)
• 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies (protect)
World health statistics 2025: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals
56
Progress needed to match regional leaders (%)
For GPW14, the targets are recalibrated to reflect absolute population coverage by 2028, accounting for 
improved measurement methods and setting ambitious yet realistic goals:
• 6 billion people living healthier lives (promote)
• 5 billion people benefitting from universal health coverage without financial hardship (provide)
• 7 billion people protected from health emergencies (protect)
The revised Triple Billion targets offer several benefits:
• Better alignment with global targets, including the SDGs and World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions
• Enable scenario analysis for assessing health interventions at regional and country levels
• Facilitate direct statistical forecasting using past trends and country-specific data
• Support benchmarking assessments to identify best practices at regional and global levels
• Balance ambition with realism, ensuring achievable yet aspirational goals
• Account for uncertainty in observed data and future projections
• Promote equity, ensuring that no one is left behind or unprotected.
3.6 Conclusion
The WHO Triple Billion framework has served as both 
a strategic guide and a practical tool for accountability 
and accelerating progress in global health. By providing 
a structured approach to tracking advancements in 
indicators across regions and countries, it offers decision￾makers actionable insights on where to focus resources 
and policy interventions. The 2025 projections, developed 
using the most recent available data, reveal both 
encouraging progress and gaps that require targeted 
action. Regional analysis shows how varied approaches 
to reaching these targets reflect different priorities, 
challenges and opportunities across the six WHO regions.
Looking ahead, as WHO transitions from GPW13 to 
GPW14 in 2025, the core structure of the Triple Billion 
targets remains in place. However, the list of outcome 
indicators has been updated to reflect emerging health 
challenges and strategic priorities set collectively by 
the global community for GPW14 (see Box 3.1). Through 
GPW14, WHO reaffirms its unwavering commitment to 
addressing emerging global health priorities and tackling 
challenges, as mandated by its Member States, despite an 
evolving global landscape.

Inequality in 
immunization 
Ensuring equitable access to immunization is vital for achieving 
public health goals and ensuring that every person, regardless of 
their background and circumstances, fully benefits from vaccines to 
improve health and well-being. This chapter presents the state of 
inequality in immunization coverage. It shows how inequalities in 
immunization have changed in the last decade and discusses barriers 
to achieving equitable immunization coverage.
4.1 The importance of 
vaccine equity
1 Also referred to as the slope index of inequality.
Vaccines are life-saving interventions that have 
dramatically improved global health outcomes. 
Immunization currently prevents 3.5 million to 5 million 
deaths every year from diseases such as diphtheria, 
tetanus, pertussis, measles and influenza (1). Since 
the launch of the WHO Expanded Programme on 
Immunization in the mid-1970s, childhood vaccination 
coverage has improved significantly, contributing to a 
substantial reduction in U5MR (2). This underscores the 
critical role of vaccines in safeguarding public health and 
highlights the importance of continuing efforts to ensure 
equitable access to immunization worldwide. 
Equity in immunization is a cornerstone of the 
Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), which envisions a 
world where everyone, everywhere, at every age fully 
benefits from vaccines to improve health and well-being
(3). This global strategy aims to leave no one behind by 
increasing equitable access to vaccines, ensuring that 
immunization programmes are integrated into primary 
health care and contributing to achieving universal 
health coverage. 
Global inequalities persist in vaccine access, financing, 
availability and distribution – both between countries 
and within countries. Low-income countries often face 
challenges in securing sufficient vaccine supplies due 
to limited financial resources, disruptions in health-care 
services, logistical challenges and inequities in access 
to services (4). 
Within countries, inequalities in vaccine access and 
coverage can be influenced by factors such as geographic 
location, socioeconomic status and education levels. 
Rural and remote areas may have lower access to 
vaccination services compared with urban centres, and 
those affected by social disadvantage may face barriers 
to immunization due to lack of information or logistical 
challenges. Addressing inequalities requires targeted 
efforts to strengthen health systems, improve vaccine 
delivery infrastructure and ensure that immunization 
programmes are inclusive and accessible to all segments 
of the population. 
4.2 Inequalities in immunization 
coverage persist within 
countries
The delivery of three doses of the combined DTP3 vaccine 
among children under the age of 1 year is used as a proxy 
indicator for monitoring the capacity of a health system 
to reliably reach children through routine vaccination 
channels. Measuring inequalities in DTP3 immunization 
coverage within countries reveals where gaps exist 
in a routinely delivered vaccine and helps to inform 
appropriate approaches to reach under-vaccinated 
populations. 
Figure 4.1 shows median inequality in DTP3 immunization 
coverage across LICs and middle-income countries with a 
recent household survey (from 2014–2023) by economic 
status, education and place of residence. For economic 
status and education, inequality is measured as the 
difference along the socioeconomic spectrum, while 
taking the composition of every socioeconomic subgroup 
into consideration.1
 For place of residence, inequality 
is measured as the difference between urban and rural 
subgroups. Medians are calculated across all countries 
60
with data available, as well as by World Bank country 
income grouping. 
The results indicate inequalities favouring those living in 
richer households (median economic-related inequality 
of 10.4 percentage points across 88 countries), having 
more education (median education-related inequality of 
18.7 percentage points across 67 countries) and living in 
urban areas (median difference of 2.3 percentage 
points across 89 countries). Economic-related inequality 
in DTP3 immunization coverage is most pronounced in 
LICs and LMICs, where there are median inequalities of 
13.7 and 13.0 percentage points in coverage along the 
economic status spectrum, respectively. Education￾related inequality was high across UMICs, LMICs and LICs, 
while differences between urban and rural areas were low 
overall across country income groupings.

The number of children who have not received any 
routine vaccines (referred to as zero-dose children) 
reflects the accessibility of basic health services, 
including immunization services. The IA2030 includes an 
objective to extend immunization services to regularly 
reach zero-dose children, with a target of a 50% 
reduction in zero-dose children between 2019 and 2030 
(3). An analysis of inequalities in the proportion of 1-year￾old children who had not received any doses of the DTP 
vaccine, using household survey data across 88 countries, 
reveals substantial economic- and education-related 
inequalities (Fig. 4.2). Data from 87 countries showed a 
median economic-related inequality of 6.7 percentage 
points in zero-dose DTP prevalence, but inequalities 
were particularly pronounced across LMICs and LICs, 
where median economic-related inequality was greater 
than 9 percentage points. Across 66 countries, median 
education-related inequality in zero-dose prevalence 
was 10.5 percentage points but inequalities were 
16 percentage points in LMICs and LICs. Overall, there 
was low median inequality between rural and urban 
areas in 88 countries, but zero-dose prevalence was 
slightly higher in rural than urban areas in LMICs 
and LICs.

Eliminating economic-related inequality in DTP3 
coverage and zero-dose prevalence has the potential 
for many more children to benefit from immunization. 
The potential for improvement in each country is 
premised on all children achieving the same outcome 
as the richest 20% of households. If economic-related 
inequality in DTP3 coverage were eliminated across the 
88 countries with household survey data from 2014–2023, 
the weighted national average across these countries 
would improve from 76.0% to 85.5% (Fig. 4.3). If countries 
reduced the prevalence of zero-dose children to that of 
the richest subgroup, the weighted national average 
prevalence would be more than halved, from 13.1% 
to 6.3%.

Of 88 countries with household survey data from 
2014–2023, only 27 had DTP3 coverage of 90% or more, 
while coverage was 80–89% in 20 countries, 70–79% in 
12 countries and below 70% in 29 countries (Fig. 4.4A). 
After considering the potential improvement in 
national average by eliminating economic-related 
inequality, 6 additional countries would have coverage 
greater than 90% and 10 additional countries would 
have coverage of 80–89%. If economic-related 
inequality in zero-dose prevalence were eliminated, 
16 additional countries would reduce zero-dose 
prevalence to below 5% (Fig. 4.4B). The link between 
economic status and immunization coverage is 
complex and, as Box 4.1 shows, inequalities can 
emerge at various points of contact with the health 
system – underscoring the need for exploration of the 
drivers of inequalities and context-specific strategies 
to address them.

Inequality in immunization 
63
Box 4.1 Inequalities can be introduced through interventions: the example of tetanus 
immunization coverage at birth
Maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT) is a form of tetanus that affects women during pregnancy or within six 
weeks of the end of pregnancy, and infants during their first 28 days of life (6). MNT constitutes a major public 
health concern, as neonatal case-fatality rates are upwards of 80% and approach 100% when untreated (7). 
Immunization of pregnant women against tetanus is a key strategy for reducing tetanus morbidity and mortality 
while also achieving the goal of maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination. An infant’s tetanus protection at 
birth (PAB) is comprised of immunization received by the woman during and before her pregnancy (e.g. through 
childhood vaccination, booster doses or mass vaccination campaigns, or during prior pregnancies).
Global inequalities in tetanus immunization coverage at birth are evident across various dimensions, including 
wealth, maternal age, education and place of residence (8). For instance, poorer households, younger maternal 
age, lower education of the mother and residence in rural areas tend to have lower rates of PAB. These 
inequalities are particularly pronounced in LICs and LMICs, but they also persist in UMICs, especially concerning 
education level of the mother and rural residence. 
Findings from a study of 71 LICs and middle-income countries suggest that the majority of tetanus immunization 
PAB for first births is the result of vaccinations received during pregnancy. The extent of economic-related 
inequality in PAB increases during pregnancy, as more women from richer households than women from poorer 
households are vaccinated during pregnancy (9). Economic-related inequality is measured as the difference 
along the socioeconomic spectrum, while taking the composition of every socioeconomic subgroup into 
consideration. Overall, LICs and middle-income countries had similar levels of economic-related inequality 
and tetanus immunization coverage before pregnancy. However, increases in tetanus immunization coverage 
at birth were coupled with increases in inequality in LICs, overall, in contrast with UMICs (Fig. 4.5). Inequalities 
in coverage at birth in this group were introduced during pregnancy, likely driven in part by inequalities in 
antenatal care access and utilization. Addressing these inequalities requires targeted interventions to improve 
access to and uptake of tetanus vaccines among women from poorer households, ensuring that all pregnant 
women and newborns receive adequate protection against this preventable disease.

coverage level before pregnancy and at birth, by World Bank country income group,

The start of the arrow indicates the level of economic-related inequality and tetanus immunization coverage before pregnancy and the end of the arrow

4.3 How inequalities have changed 
over time
Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been 
made to address inequalities in immunization coverage. 
IA2030 and its predecessor, the Global Vaccine Action Plan 
for 2011–2020, focus on reaching zero-dose children and 
ensuring equitable access to vaccines. Collaborations 
between WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, 
have significantly impacted the number of zero-dose 
children in lower-income countries. For example, these 
efforts have helped to reduce the number of zero-dose 
children from 15.8 million in 2010 to 12.8 million in 
2019 (10). However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted 
in setbacks to vaccination programmes, resulting 
in an increase in the number of zero-dose children 
to 14.5 million in 2023. In response to disruptions 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO and UNICEF 
launched catch-up and recovery programmes to restore 
immunization services. Targeted vaccination campaigns
in low-coverage regions aim to close immunization gaps 
and prevent outbreaks.
The overall change in inequality in DTP3 immunization 
coverage and zero-dose prevalence can be measured 
using the median difference along the socioeconomic 
spectrum (while taking the composition of every 
socioeconomic subgroup into consideration). Between 
2004–2013 and 2014–2023, overall economic- and 
education-related inequalities in DTP3 immunization 
coverage decreased (Fig. 4.6). Across 72 countries, 
economic-related inequality in DTP3 coverage reduced 
from a median of 15.4 to 11.0 percentage points, and 
education-related inequality across 56 countries reduced 
from a median of 22.1 to 18.7 percentage points. Overall, 
economic- and education-related inequalities in zero￾dose prevalence only decreased slightly over this period.

Inequality in immunization 
65
Changes in immunization inequality related to economic 
status, education and place of residence varied across 
country income groupings. Broadly, in the last decade 
there has been a convergence in inequalities across LICs 
and LMICs, with inequalities diminishing in LICs to the 
point that their median level of inequality in 2014–2023 
was similar to (or better than) that of LMICs. In particular, 
2 The Equity Reference Group for Immunization is an action-oriented think tank that consists of senior experts in global health working with WHO, Gavi, the 
World Bank, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and UNICEF; academic experts in metrics, gender, and health systems development; and senior leaders from the 
ministries of health in Indonesia, Ethiopia and the United Republic of Tanzania.
3 The Gender Inequality Index is a composite metric of gender inequality using three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market. It 
shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions.
across 19 LICs, economic-related inequality in DTP3 
coverage and zero-dose prevalence reduced by more 
than half, from 26.2 to 11.8 percentage points and from 
17.2 to 8.0 percentage points, respectively. In UMICs, 
inequality remained the same for zero-dose prevalence 
but economic- and education-related inequality in DTP3 
coverage increased.
4.4 Barriers to immunization 
The Equity Reference Group for Immunization2
 has 
identified several thematic priorities to address 
inequities in immunization coverage, including urban 
poor areas, remote/rural areas, children affected by 
conflict, and gender-related inequities and barriers 
(11). In such contexts, different strategies are needed to 
understand coverage levels and address inequities in 
immunization coverage. Surveys are rarely carried out to 
enable the accurate assessment of coverage rates in the 
above contexts, and when they are, they generally lack 
granularity. This results in a scarcity of disaggregated 
data and inadequate monitoring of inequalities. 
Consequently, it is challenging to identify disadvantaged 
groups within these contexts and implement 
programmes that prioritize reaching them. 
In urban poor areas, overcrowding and poverty can 
significantly hinder vaccine delivery and uptake. These 
areas often lack adequate health-care facilities and 
resources, making it challenging to maintain consistent 
immunization services. Remote rural regions face similar 
issues, with limited health-care infrastructure and difficult 
terrain further complicating efforts to reach all children. 
For instance, a study in Malawi found that proximity to 
a health facility providing vaccination services in rural 
areas was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine 
receipt, and that remote rural children were more likely to 
be under-vaccinated (12). Additionally, children affected 
by conflict experience unique barriers to immunization. 
Conflict zones often see disrupted health services, 
displacement of populations and heightened insecurity, 
all of which contribute to lower immunization rates. 
These children may miss out on routine vaccinations due 
to instability and lack of access to health care. 
Gender-related barriers can hinder immunization 
coverage by limiting women’s autonomy and decision￾making power, which affects their ability to access health 
services for themselves and their children. Additionally, 
cultural norms and practices may restrict women’s 
mobility and access to information, further reducing 
vaccination coverage in communities with high gender 
inequality. Women with higher social independence, as 
measured by the Survey-based Women’s Empowerment 
Global Index, are more likely to ensure their children 
receive vaccinations (13). In contrast, DTP3 coverage 
tends to be lower, and zero-dose prevalence 
higher, among children of women with lower social 
independence. 
At the subnational and national levels, areas with higher 
gender inequality tend to have lower immunization 
coverage. In a study of 162 countries, those with high 
gender inequality (favouring men), as measured using 
the Gender Inequality Index,3
 had DTP3 immunization 
coverage that was 13 percentage points lower (median 
value of 81% versus 94%) and zero-dose prevalence 
7 percentage points higher (median value of 10% versus 
3%) than countries with lower inequality (14). A study 
of 702 subnational regions across 57 countries also 
found that regions with greater gender inequality had 
lower DTP3 coverage and higher zero-dose prevalence 
(15). Subnational regions with higher gender inequality 
(favouring men), as measured by the Subnational 
Gender Development Index, had DTP3 immunization 
coverage that was 21.6 percentage points lower, while 
zero-dose prevalence was 13.4 percentage points higher 
(median values).

4.5 Data availability to monitor 
inequalities in immunization 
Monitoring inequalities in immunization relies on 
various data sources, each with its own advantages 
and disadvantages (16). Administrative data are 
routinely collected by health facilities and can provide 
timely, comprehensive information on immunization 
coverage. These data are cost-effective and cover large 
populations, making them useful for tracking trends 
over time. However, administrative data can suffer from 
inaccuracies due to reporting errors, incomplete records, 
sparse information about dimensions of inequality 
and uncertainty about target population numbers. 
Household survey data, such as those from DHS and 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), offer detailed, 
population-based insights into immunization coverage. 
These surveys are valuable for capturing data on hard￾to-reach populations and for validating administrative 
data. They also provide rich contextual information, such 
as socioeconomic and demographic factors. However, 
household surveys are expensive, time-consuming and 
conducted infrequently, which can limit their utility for 
real-time monitoring. 
Data availability can be a challenge, particularly in LICs 
where resources for comprehensive data collection 
and reporting are often limited. These countries may 
face difficulties in maintaining accurate and up-to￾date records, which can hinder efforts to monitor 
and address immunization inequalities effectively. 
Logistical challenges, such as limited access to remote 
areas and insufficient funding for large-scale surveys, 
further complicate data collection efforts. Inaccurate 
estimates of the target population for vaccination 
can exacerbate these difficulties, particularly when 
monitoring subnational inequalities and subpopulations 
of interest. Misestimations can lead to skewed coverage 
rates, masking inequalities and making it challenging 
to identify and address areas with the greatest need 
(17). Addressing these challenges requires investment 
in strengthening health information systems to ensure 
reliable data are available for informed decision-making 
and targeted interventions.
A scoping review of publications in academic journals 
analysing inequalities in immunization coverage among 
children revealed a rise in the use of DHS and MICS data 
between 2014 and 2023 (Fig. 4.7) (18). Across the 10-year 
period, 129 papers (54%) had utilized DHS and/or MICS 
data, demonstrating the utility of these data sources for 
monitoring inequalities in immunization. The number of 
publications using administrative, health or surveillance 
records remained relatively stable, as did those based 
on other sources such as non-routine, study-specific or 
small-scale surveys.

Annexes
Annex 1.
Progress assessment of selected health-related SDG 
indicators by WHO region
A summary of progress of selected health-related SDG 
indicators is presented in Table A1.1 for Goal 3 (Health 
and Well-being) indicators and Table A1.2 for those 
outside of Goal 3.
An indicator is included in the assessment if it meets the 
following criteria: 
 There is an explicit numerical SDG or other global 
framework target to be achieved by a defined year, 
applicable at both global and regional levels. 
 Estimates are available for the baseline year and 
at least one other later year to enable a trend 
assessment. 
For each indicator, the numbers shown in the global 
and regional cells are the latest available estimated 
values. The reference year of these values is indicated in 
the corresponding column.
Progress is assessed based on the latest available value, 
and the projected value for the target year based on 
current trends. Unless otherwise noted, current trends 
are defined by the average annual rates of change 
between the baseline year and the reference year of the 
latest available value. Progress is described in three 
categories as follows:
 “Target reached”: target is already achieved
 “Progress on track”: target will be achieved by the 
target year based on current trends
 “Acceleration needed”: target will not be met by 
the target year based on current trends
It is noted that this method of assessment may differ 
from those used by the United Nations Statistics 
Division or by the custodian agencies of individual 
indicators, leading to different assessment results.
Tables A1.3 and A1.4 provide the list of health-related 
SDG indicators that are not included in Tables A1.1 
and A1.2.

Annex 2.
Summary of methodology
Chapter 1
The analysis presented in Chapter 1 is based on the 
WHO Global health estimates 2021 (GHE2021), which 
included the latest estimates on life expectancy, healthy 
life expectancy, causes of deaths and disability globally, 
by region and country, and by age and sex. The GHE2021 
were produced using data from multiple sources, including 
national vital registration data, latest estimates from WHO 
technical programmes, United Nations partners and inter￾agency groups, and the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation Global Burden of Disease and other scientific 
studies. The GHE2021 was reviewed by WHO Member 
States through consultation with national focal points and 
WHO country and regional offices. The GHE2021 summary 
of methodology can be accessed online (1). 
Secondary analysis was performed using well-established 
demographic methods to decompose the change and 
difference in healthy life expectancy over time or between 
different populations, by age and cause, using GHE2021 
data (2,3).
Chapter 2
The analysis presented in Chapter 2 is based on data 
available from the global monitoring of health-related 
SDG indicators as of April 2025. Data were compiled from 
publications and databases produced and managed by 
WHO or United Nations partner entities. The methodology 
for each indicator is available from the cited references for 
the chapter. The data reference years for each indicator 
differ as data series are updated on different timelines and 
with different lags between the data reference year and the 
publication year. Unless otherwise stated, the assessment 
of progress towards reaching a target is determined by 
whether the target will be met if the current average 
annual rate of change applies until the target year.
Chapter 3
The Triple Billion estimates in Chapter 3 were calculated 
following the WHO GPW13 measurement framework, 
developed through extensive review and consultation 
with experts, WHO regional offices and Member States (4). 
Estimates were derived from 46 outcome indicators (5), 
using the latest available country-level data as of March 
2025. Indicator-level projections were generated using 
statistical forecasting models that account for historical 
trends, data sparsity and recent developments, according 
to methods in Concept and methodologies in estimation 
and forecasting of Triple Billion targets and improving the 
WHO results framework (6).
Additionally, two hypothetical scenarios are presented. 
The first shows estimated progress if all countries were 
to achieve the annualized targets set by the 2030 Agenda 
(5,7). This scenario was constructed by calculating a 
population-weighted global average of expected 2030 
values for each indicator. Each country’s expected 2030 
value was adjusted by the proportion needed to close 
the gap between the global average and the SDG target/
indicator. The second scenario shows potential gains in 
progress if countries within each WHO region were to 
match the expected progress of top countries in their 
respective regions by 2030. Region-specific targets are 
defined as the top decile of the regional distribution of 
2030 values for each indicator. Country-specific trajectories 
for the scenario were calculated by finding the annualized 
rate of change required to meet regional-targets, from a 
baseline year of 2023.
Chapter 4
Economic status is measured using a wealth index and 
is composed of five subgroups, each accounting for 20% 
of the population. Education refers to the highest level 
of education attained by the mother and is composed of 
three subgroups (no education, primary education and 
secondary or higher education). For economic status and 
education, inequality was measured as the difference 
along the socioeconomic spectrum, while taking the 
composition of every socioeconomic subgroup into 
consideration. This is also known as the slope index of 
inequality (SII). Subgroups were ranked from the most 
disadvantaged to the most advantaged, factoring in 
their population sizes, and the indicator value regressed 
against these relative ranks. SII represents the absolute 
difference between the two extremes of this regression 
line. For place of residence, inequality was measured as 
the difference between urban and rural subgroups (for 
DTP3 coverage) and the difference between rural and 
urban subgroups (for zero-dose prevalence). Since place 
of residence is categorized into two subgroups (urban 
and rural), the inequality measured by the difference 
might be less than when there are more subgroups (as 
is the case with economic status and education). This is 
because a larger number of groupings typically captures 
more heterogeneity. Globally and within World Bank 
country income groups, inequality was calculated as the 
median difference across countries. Change in inequality 
over time was measured using countries with two data 
points, from 2004 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2023 (spanning 
approximately 10 years).
